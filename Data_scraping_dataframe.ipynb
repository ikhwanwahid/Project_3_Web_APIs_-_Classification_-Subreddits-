    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "<br> We are the good folks at Askscience subreddit forums, bringing to you up and coming and interesting Science <br>facts, news fresh off the oven for your reading pleasure.\n",
    "<br>Nowadays with the many cross-overs that happen between fields, topics that sound related but are not actually <br>related or relevant to our cause have seemed to pop up into our subreddit feeds. More prevalantly , the posting <br>of troll posts, or jokes mocking Science or in no way relevant to Science in anyway.\n",
    "<br>Our job now is to invent a ML algorithm to correctly dectect such posts that dont belong,and subsequently <br>filter,remove them from our feed. "

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "Reddit is an American social news compiler,web content rating and discussion website. Members submit content to the site such as links,text posts and images which are upvoted or downvoted by the community.\n",
    "Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called \"subreddits\", which cover a variety of topics including news, science, movies, video games, music, books, fitness, food, and image-sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it is an open community, everyone can post whenever/wherever and whatever they want. Most often then not random posts unrelated to the subreddit will appear. While the immediate solution is for moderators to spot them and remove, how efficient can this process be?\n",
    "There is only so much a modertor can detect, before the amount of posts posted becomes too overwhelming for it to be done manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus arrives the need for automation, filtering out the irrelevant posts and keeping the subreddit accurate.\n",
    "Our job now is to invent a ML algorithm to correctly dectect such posts that dont belong,and subsequently\n",
    "filter,remove them from our feed.\n",

Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.\\n\\n-----------------\\n\\nIdeally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise.

I am just going to state my thinking and help me point out the problem. At the equator your body is traveling fast in a circle and the inertia of your body makes you continue to move out-word, this is the centrifugal force. At the poles you are moving not at all or much slower in a circle so your inertia has less effect. With less out-word force the normal force, or your wieght, would have to compensate so you would weigh more. At the equator the centrifugal force lessons your weight ( not mass ) because it helps counteract gravity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.\\n\\nMembership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!\\n\\n---\\n\\n**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**\\n\\n* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,\\n\\n* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.\\n\\n\\n------------------\\n\\n**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**\\n\\n* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).\\n\\n* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)\\n\\n* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)\\n\\n* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?\\n\\n* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.\\n\\n-----------------\\n\\nIdeally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.\\n\\nHere's an example application:\\n\\n       Username: /u/foretopsail\\n       General field: Anthropology\\n       Specific field: Maritime Archaeology\\n       Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction. \\n       Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.\\n       Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.\\n\\nPlease do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.\\n\\nYou can submit your application by replying to this post.\",\n",

       "\"**Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**\\n\\nThis post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/amj68a/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xx/).\\n\\nThe panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.\\n\\nMembership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!\\n\\n---\\n\\n**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**\\n\\n* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,\\n\\n* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.\\n\\n\\n------------------\\n\\n**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**\\n\\n* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).\\n\\n* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)\\n\\n* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)\\n\\n* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?\\n\\n* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.\\n\\n-----------------\\n\\nIdeally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.\\n\\nHere's an example application:\\n\\n       Username: /u/foretopsail\\n       General field: Anthropology\\n       Specific field: Maritime Archaeology\\n       Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction. \\n       Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.\\n       Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.\\n\\nPlease do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.\\n\\nYou can submit your application by replying to this post.\""
