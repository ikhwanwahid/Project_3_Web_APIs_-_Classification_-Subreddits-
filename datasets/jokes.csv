However, one day his son came home with terrible news: ""Dad, I've made up my mind I'm going vegetarian!""

He could accept anything else, but that! Shocked, he threw his son out of his house.

As the months and years went by, he regretted his decision, and decided that maybe he should try to understand his son's point of view. So he read up about the nutritional value of plants, looked up recipes, and even asked the neighbouring squirrels about what they ate.

Finally, one cold evening, he decided that it was time to try out eating plants. Peas were a good place to start- they were high in protein, like the rotting flesh he usually ate, and they were easy for him to eat with his beak. So in addition to his usual plate of roadkill, he put on a pot of peas to boil.

Suddenly there was a knock at the door. He opened it and gasped with surprise- there was his son, thin as sticks and weak as water! His son collapsed into his wings, and managed to croak out,

Thinking that it was just a phase, his father didn&amp;#39;t worry too much about it and hoped that one day his son would grow up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one day his son came home with terrible news: &amp;quot;Dad, I&amp;#39;ve made up my mind I&amp;#39;m going vegetarian!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He could accept anything else, but that! Shocked, he threw his son out of his house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the months and years went by, he regretted his decision, and decided that maybe he should try to understand his son&amp;#39;s point of view. So he read up about the nutritional value of plants, looked up recipes, and even asked the neighbouring squirrels about what they ate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one cold evening, he decided that it was time to try out eating plants. Peas were a good place to start- they were high in protein, like the rotting flesh he usually ate, and they were easy for him to eat with his beak. So in addition to his usual plate of roadkill, he put on a pot of peas to boil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there was a knock at the door. He opened it and gasped with surprise- there was his son, thin as sticks and weak as water! His son collapsed into his wings, and managed to croak out,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dad, I&amp;#39;m starving. Do you have anything for me to eat?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crying at seeing his long-lost child after so many years, he nodded and said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Carrion, my wayward son! There&amp;#39;ll be peas when you are done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

,Jokes,"They’re very tired, and they decide to take a shortcut across a nearby river to quickly reach  their camp. 

As they cross the river, a tribe of savages charge out of the trees and surround them. The tribe Chief steps forward and says

“This river sacred ground... you trespass on sacred ground! Now, as punishment, you DIE.”

The Chief goes on to explain that after they kill them, the tribe will use their skin to make canoes. They will then sail these canoes on the river as a warning to future trespassers. 

However, (as he is a kind leader) the Chief decides that although the three men  must die, they may choose how they die and even do it themselves if they wish. The three men agree, and the Englishman goes first

“I would like a gun, please”

The Chief hands him a gun. The Englishman thanks him, shouts “GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!” and blows his own brains out. The tribe drag his corpse away to turn into a canoe. The Frenchman goes next

“I would like some poison, si vous plait”

The Chief hands him some poison. The Frenchman thanks him, shouts “VIVA LA FRANCE!” and drinks it. He instantly dies, and the tribe drag his corpse away to turn into a canoe. Finally, it’s the Scotsman’s turn 

“I want a fork”

The Chief is very confused, but nevertheless hands him a fork. The Scotsman thanks the Chief, before beginning to frantically stab himself all over his body.

&lt;p&gt;“This river sacred ground... you trespass on sacred ground! Now, as punishment, you DIE.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chief goes on to explain that after they kill them, the tribe will use their skin to make canoes. They will then sail these canoes on the river as a warning to future trespassers. &lt;/p&gt;

St. Peter looks alarmed, and says ""You must NEVER step on a duck! Those are God's favorite! If you step on a duck, you'll be punished for all eternity!""  

The three are left to their own devices, but inevitably one of them steps on a duck. After much quacking ensued, St. Peter sternly marches up and handcuffs the offender to the ugliest woman the three have ever seen. ""You were warned! Now you're attached to her for all eternity!""  

The other two are now much more careful about trying to avoid stepping on ducks, but as luck would have it, one of them manages to do so, to the same scenario with an even uglier woman.  

The remaining man is so careful he can hardly move, but manages to go for several years without stepping on a duck.  

In spite of this, he sees St. Peter sternly approaching him with a woman and a pair of handcuffs. But the woman isn't ugly, she's drop-dead gorgeous!

,Jokes,"A man gets home after leaving work early and finds his wife in bed with a stranger.

He silently grabs his pistol, making sure that he doesn't get noticed by his wife and her lover, and prepares to shoot them both.

Suddenly, a few thoughts come to his mind. He started to remember the previous six months.

&amp;nbsp;

For some reason, his wife stopped asking him for money to buy new clothes, yet every other week, she came home with new clothes, new shoes, new earrings.

Their kids stopped going to public school. This year, they started going to that fancy private school with a very good reputation.

The new car, yeah that's right, his wife got a new car. He always thought it was a little weird, given that he doesn't get a raise in nearly 5 years, he can barely save money for himself, and his income is supposed to be higher than hers, but he never really gave it any thought.

Now that he thinks about it, despite his shit income, he's been eating like a king these past few months. There has always been food at the table, good food, steak every week, quality wine every so often, the fridge is full, he's been eating pretty much what he wants when he wants.

Bills? He now remembers that he's not been seeing them for a while. For some reason, the bills stopped being a problem, and now that he thinks about it, he never got to question why.

Life has been very good.

&amp;nbsp;

He looks at his wife again, she's having sex with that stranger, a man he's never seen before in his life, shamelessly using his wife like she belongs to him, in that same bed he sleeps in.

Feelings of rage and disgust cloud his brain, he has the finger on the trigger, he's ready to shoot. But he starts thinking again.

&amp;nbsp;

The truth was that his wife was a bomb. She's well in her forties, yet her beauty remains the same as when she was young, that woman seems imune to aging, even after giving birth to 2 kids. She had a good pair of tits, a round delicious booty, and sex with her was simply amazing.

Hell, seeing her in action right now was just reinforcing the idea of how perfect she was in bed.

&amp;nbsp;

He stood there silent for one more minute, pointing his pistol at his wife and her lover, while reflecting on those thoughts.

Then, he silently puts his pistol back in its place, and slowly leaves the room, still careful so he doesn't get noticed.

He says to himself:

-The motherfucker pays for my wife's clothes, buys her a new car, pays for the kids private school, pays for the food so I get to eat like a king for free, and he even pays all our bills. Yet, at the end of the day, I still get to have passionate sex with my hot wife when I get home every day...

&amp;nbsp;

He closes the door behind him, and laughing, reaches the conclusion:

,Jokes,"There was a little boy who lived in a far away land. Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.  


Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there.  


One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  


So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  


The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.  


As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  


So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  


The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.  


As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  


So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  


That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.  


The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.  


He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.  


""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


""Well, then can I become a monk?""  


""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""  


So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.  


""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk.""  


So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.  


""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.  


The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""  


""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""  


Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end.  


Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!  


Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.  


""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""  


""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""  


The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.  


Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor.  


The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.  


Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!  


Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!  
He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.  


""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.""  


""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""  


The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.  


Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.  


Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.  


Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!  


Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!  


Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!  


He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.  


Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside.  


Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!  


""Do you want me to tell you what it was?""

Close to the boy&amp;#39;s home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry,&amp;quot; replied the head monk, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t tell you. You aren&amp;#39;t a monk.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.  &lt;/p&gt;

,Jokes,"A couple of years ago, one night, I was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate Joseph barged into the room out of nowhere, tripped and fell over, breaking a glass table with his face. Totally ruined the mood. Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let' just say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

I sleep on a top bunk bed because I stripped the bottom bunk out to make space for my piano and cupboards. Total walking space in my bedroom - a modest 3m². Ideal for moments of circular contemplation.

I was telling my boss about all this recently. She's a lovely woman. Very thoughtful and accommodating, appreciative, caring and happy. And she likes to enjoy a nice craft beer at the end of the day.

I was telling her about the miserly amount of sleeping space I get in my bunk bed, because it's made of metal and has a headboard and feetboard(?) which locks my 6'4"" body inside a 6'3"" frame. So most nights I sleep like an unmotivated starfish. If its proper baltic and the metal feetboard feels like ice on my toes then I will sleep fetal - but I prefer not be scrunched up.

My boss listened attentively to my tales of woe, which must have been very boring for her.

I moaned about the unsatisfactory dimensions of UK bunk beds, and how successive generations of kids are generally taller than the last, but bunk bed lengths hadn't reflected this trend in child growth.

,Jokes," 

My grandfather was always playing pranks on people. He was originally from Ireland before he moved to the US. He fit all of the stereotypes of an Irishman, having red hair and beard, constantly being at the bar, and having an accent so thick that I could barely understand him even though I knew him for years.

In addition to all these traits, grandpa was a rather short man. Everyone he met called him a leprechaun, always asking him for his pot of gold or his Lucky Charms. They even called him a leprechaun while he still lived in Ireland, saying he was the spitting image of one.

At first, he was annoyed, just wanting to get a drink without the hassle. But after a while, he began to take advantage of the name. He was always getting people at the bar to do stupid stuff for a chance at a pot of gold. After all, it isn't that hard to convince a drunk person that a short Irish ginger is an actual leprechaun.

He was doing this for decades, and without fail there would always be at least one person at the bar he frequents that would try to get a pot of gold.

Many years passed, and grandpa started to go to the bar less and less. He said since he was getting older, he would much rather stay at home and watch whatever is on the television instead of going out to bars, getting drunk and playing pranks.

A few years later, grandpa was hospitalized. Doctors said it was his liver failing. Even though he stopped drinking recently, all the decades of abuse his liver took have finally caught up to him. Instead of being horrified or worried, grandpa looked peaceful, almost relieved. He began to calmly write his will, giving his possessions away to family members.

For most people, he wrote down normal items, like his car, television, or house. But he gave me something very different. Instead of including it in his will, he decided to give it to me in person when there was nobody else around.

""Listen,"" be began to say to me, ""I need to tell you something very important. All those years of joking about being a leprechaun... those were not jokes. I really am a leprechaun. Here, take this."" he said, handing me what looks like a small lump of metal. ""That, my boy, is my pot of gold. It might not look like much now, but if you place it down at the end of a rainbow, it will explode into a shower of golden coins. It's very important that you tell nobody about this.""

Of course, I thought he was just pulling another prank, like he has all these years before. But honestly, what do I have to lose? The next time I found a rainbow, I placed the metal at the end of it. I'm waiting for something to happen as I'm writing this, I'll keep you updated.
