askscience,"Since 2015, using NASA hardware, scientists and researchers have worked with astronauts on the International Space Station to conduct a series of experiments to grow, harvest and eat a variety of crops in space with seeds sent from Earth. The most recent experiment has the ISS crew growing Mizuna mustard using two different light recipes and multiple harvests, with the experiment's final harvest scheduled for later this week. This work builds upon decades of NASA and international research into growing plants in space.

These experiments are advancing the knowledge required to successfully grow a large variety of crops on long-duration missions, such as a crewed mission to Mars. Being able to crops grown in space provides many benefits including supplementing the astronauts' packaged diet with essential nutrients and combating diet fatigue.

Say we have a relatively small black hole, and a photon is travelling near it, surely a graviton to enact an interaction between the photon and ""attract"" it to the black hole would have to catch up to the photon which would mean it travelling faster than c.

Eventually the dirt would become spread out by the size of the universe and its contribution would tend toward 0, but never is this dirt slowing the expansion.

&amp;nbsp;

It sounds pedantic, but as I understand it a better description would be that: w=0 matter adds to expansion in a way that decreases with a and therefore time, and so in a matter dominated universe the expansion slows (but doesn't stop, see the a~t^2/3 equation or whatever) due to a's increasing, not directly due to that matter.  This makes a difference as when I was taught it, the reductive ""dark matter slows expansion"" statement misled me greatly.

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, I know the H^2 ~ density equation, but is there anything that says when solving for H we must take the positive square root for expansion and not the negative for shrinkage?","Why is regular/dark matter (w=0) said to slow down expansion?

Hello I've recently been creating a fantasy map and was looking up Atolls and I've several questions about them.

The first, is why are there so few Atolls in the Atlantic (only off the coast of Belize) while the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean are chalk full of them. I presume this is due to lack of Volcanic activity in the Atlantic ocean in area where reefs can form but then that leads to another question about the lack of Volcanic hot-spots in the Atlantic.

The second question I have is the removal of the former Island that the coral reef rings around. How does this precisely happen? I recall watching a video where it was stated that the weight of the reef somehow has something to do with it, or is it more to do with Erosion (wouldn't a barrier reef prevent erosion to a degree)?

And the last question I have is concerning the make up of islands. Since New Caldonia (&gt;40MYA) is older geologically speaking than Midway Island (27MYA) and the two are completely different (one is an Atoll the other is a proper island). Which is a roundabout way of asking, is the geological makeup of an Atoll more prone to erosion than a ""regular"" island?","Location of Atolls, Atlantic Vs Pacific?

After reading a thread earlier about viruses, I was reminded of something I read a long time ago, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was and my searches are turning up nothing. 

I remembered reading about some microorganism, I don't want to call it a Virus/Bacteria/Parasite because I'm not sure if that would be accurate, given the discussion I remember being that it was an ""outlier"" so to speak. 

It was something along the lines of it didn't use DNA/RNA for its genetic code, or had no common ancestor like everything else. I do remember it sparked theories of extraterrestrial origin (possibly dropped by a meteor, or was the original ""life"" on earth before something supplied what became life as we know it now, if that makes sense).

askscience,"Hey Askscience, I'd need help from some people that know a little in Genetics.

In general, since X and Y chromosomes aren't homologous, the Y one being smaller, ""crossing-overs"" can't happen between then. 

In any way, I read in some science magazines, that the X and the Y chromosomes still have some homologous parts between them. So would this mean that a ""crossing-over would happen ?

&amp;#x200B;

Background info : In bio class we had a test on genetics. The subject was on the color of a cat's robe, which depends on 2 allelles from X chromosomes. Eumelanin that codes a black fur and Phreomelanin that codes an orange fur. Plenty of female cats have a ""tortie"" fur, a mix of both colours, since they have 2 X chromosomes. Our aim was to show how certain male cats could have a ""tortie"" robe.

The main answer was a trisomy, after during Anaphase I so one of the cells had 2X chrs, one with the Xn allelle and on with Xr allelle. If this cell had children, there could be one with XrXnY, which would be a male ""tortie"".

If the loci of Xn and Xr aren't the same, there can be a crossing-over between the 2X's leading to one X having both allelles and the male descendant would also be ""tortie"".

But if the loci of the allelles weren't specified in the test subject, we can perfectly extrapolate if the X and Y chromosomes have only a small Homologuous part, there can be a crossing-over between them (even really unlikely) so one allelle is on the Y chromosome, and a descendant could be XnYr or XrYn ?

My teacher is really stubborn, she only believes in the magazine ""Nature"". But any renowned scientific could be ok.

Can any of you help me on this subject ?

The brain doesn't want all that information. It'd just be way overloaded if it ever got that kind of information inside.

However, the pressure is also increasing - doesn't that work against the goal of increasing the fuel vaporization? In other words, doesn't the increased pressure work to condense the fuel out of vapor and into droplets? 

Maybe both of these forces are acting on the fuel, but the temperature increase has a larger effect and ""wins out"" causing more vaporization to occur than the pressure increase causes condensation. How is the amount of vaporization even measured?

I've been trying to figure out exactly *how* a compression stroke in an engine increases the engine's efficiency. I've found many articles/posts about the effect of the increase in temperature, but nothing mentioning the condensing effects of increased pressure.

But since the temperature of the earth is increasing and especially that of the upper layers of oceans (who are most responsible for CO2 intake, I presume), how are the oceans acidifying? And why isn't CO2 released from water into the air?

This is what gives some aerosol cans their consistent pressure when a liquid like butane evaporates at is vapor pressure to fill the space when using a can. This is also why a cold can has less pressure, because the vapor pressure is lower correct?

However, for high altitude flight (decompression and exposure to external pressure), the FAA publishes a table of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time\_of\_useful\_consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_useful_consciousness) where the TUC at 37,000 feet is 30 seconds to 1 minute; half that much if there were a rapid decompression. 

At higher altitudes, all the way out to space, the TUC is only a handful of seconds.

Why?

Intuitively, I completely understand that the loss of partial O2 pressure will make my breathing inefficient, but even assuming the worst case that I can't receive ANY new oxygen from the atmosphere, I should be able at least to match my apnea performance at sea level using the oxygen I already have in my bloodstream.

Since TUC is way shorter than that, I must assume that there is another factor at play, specifically that I must be effectively losing some of the oxygen that was already in my body.

So apparently ADHD is linked to a deficiency of norepinephrine ([x](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-neuroscience-101/)). Norepinephrine is also linked to the fight or flight response, and increases heart rate, blood pressure and anxiety ([x](https://www.hormone.org/your-health-and-hormones/glands-and-hormones-a-to-z/hormones/norepinephrine), [x](https://www.healthline.com/health/epinephrine-vs-norepinephrine)). Comorbid ADHD and anxiety are also very common ([x](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/anxiety-adhd-link#1)). I've heard anxiety (specifically GAD) described as a permanent/extended fight or flight response where there is no danger but the brain/body still thinks there is. Since norepinephrine raises with anxiety/the fight or flight response, it is higher in those with anxiety or extended stress than without ([x](https://exploringyourmind.com/chronic-anxiety-and-its-link-to-norepinephrine/)). It seems to me that ADHD has a chronic deficiency of norepinephrine, while those with chronic anxiety generally have too much. How can these two things be true at the same time? 

Would it be possible for someone with ADHD to also have a condition that results in elevated norepinephrine, such as hyperPOTS, pheochromocytoma, or chronic stress? I'm pretty sure that chronic stress doesn't cure ADHD, but wouldn't it balance out your levels if they were already low? A sudden scare can trigger a release of epinephrine/norepinephrine (adreneline rush). But I don't think that purposely scaring ADHD people helps them focus?

Conditions that increase norepinephrine (specifically hyperPOTS and pheochromocytoma) are partially diagnosed by a blood test to test the norepinephrine levels in the blood ([x](https://www.healthline.com/health/catecholamines-blood)). If a blood test can accurately find out if there is too much norepinephrine, why can't a blood test that tests for low levels be used to diagnose ADHD?

Finally, SNRIs seem like a common treatment for anxiety. However, they increase norepinephrine. Isn't this the last thing you would want if you are already feeling anxious?

16 years later, I'm working on a loose sequel, set on board an imaginary British space module in 1967.

I asked him if it was one of those huge masses of gas in space, and he said it probably wasn't, and he wasn't exactly sure what it was. He did a lot of science and mathematics in university, so I trusted him. I am also relatively knowledgeable in physics (brag), but I couldn't think of what it could be. I forgot about it, and then we went to bed (tent?) at 11 pm-ish. At 3 am, I got up to go pee, and it was in the exact same spot as when I saw it hours ago, even though the rest of the starts and gas masses had shifted around. At that point I realised that it had to be in our atmosphere, or spinning with the earth at least, because it hadn't moved. It also definitely couldn't have been a cloud or anything physically light because at that time it was insanely windy at sea level, so I couldn't imagine what it would be like that far up. Still now, months later, I have no idea what it could have been. Does anyone in the entire r/science community have an idea?

If closed strings can move through different universes, doesn’t that violate the law of conservation of energy in our universe? Sure, energy is used to make that string (maybe a Big Bang from another universe or something), but if it did not originate from our universe and energy from our universe was not used to create it, then our universe just had an increase in its total energy/mass. Or on the other hand, if a closed stringed particle created by our Big Bang leaves our universe, then our universe lost some of its total energy. But both ways, this means that the universe isn’t actually an isolated system (because energy entered the universe), or the law of conservation was violated for a split second.

askscience,"Botanical dietary supplements, sometimes called herbals or herbal dietary supplements, and essential oils are products made from plants, plant parts, or plant extracts. One study found that natural products, including botanical dietary supplements, are used by approximately [15% of adults](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211315) and are widely available in the United States. In fact, according to the [American Botanical Council](http://cms.herbalgram.org/press/2019/2018HerbMarketReport.html), Americans spent a total of $8.8 billion on botanical dietary supplements in 2018.

But, just because a product is from a plant source and sold in stores or online, doesntt mean it's safe. The safety of a botanical or essential oil depends on many things, such as its chemical makeup, how it works in the body, how it is prepared, and the dose used.

The amount of scientific evidence available for various botanical supplement ingredients varies widely, in part, because product safety is not tested by FDA and federal law does not require dietary supplements be tested for effectiveness before they are marketed.

Studying the potential effects of botanical dietary supplements has several unique challenges. For example, all botanical dietary supplements contain a complex mixture of ingredients, making it difficult to identify and link active ingredients to health effects. Growing, harvesting, and processing conditions can also affect the chemical makeup of a botanical supplement, leading to challenges in manufacturing identical products batch after batch. Possible contaminants - either accidental or intentional via adulteration - in botanical dietary supplements (e.g. heavy metals, microbes, undeclared ingredients, or pesticides) needs to be
determined as part of routine quality control since these can affect its safety.

Our hosts today are all experts on studying the quality, safety, and/or efficacy of botanical dietary supplements and essential oils to better understand how to use them more safely and effectively.

askscience,"In some theories of expansion, the extremely fast expansion in the early universe can be explained by a field in a unique ""false vacuum"" high-energy state.  From my understanding it's called a ""false vacuum"" because even though it was relatively stable (like a ""true vacuum""), there were large energy discrepancies between this field and the other field.

The energy in this field eventually distributed itself into other fields, resulting in the creation of particles and slowing down  expansion.  Some theorists also posit that dark energy is coming from a similar source - a high-energy field in a ""false vacuum.""   Some theorists go further to suggest the idea of ""vacuum collapse"" where this dark-energy field redistributes it's energy, resulting in a redefinition of all particles.

My question is thus: do these theories make any claims about an ""absolute zero"" for a quantum field, or is all ""energy"" in a quantum field relative?  We are able to measure the energy in these theoretical fields due to their effect on our universe, but is this measure of energy an absolute measure or is it just a measuring energy discrepancy?

To take it a step further, is there anything in QFT that would stop me positing the existence of *another unknown* field that could serve as an energy sink for this current universe?  I mean, obviously there is no proof that this field exists - we would need to see some sort of observable effect on our universe in order to begin seriously entertaining the idea - but I'm wondering if there are any theoretical concepts that pin down ""negative"" (relative to our current universe) QFT energies.","Is the ""vacuum"" state of a field in QFT relative or absolute?",1

askscience,"We ran a shelter for Balkan street dogs.  As I had little knowledge of dogs up to that point, I assumed what I learned from these dogs was 'how dogs were'.  When we returned home, we brought two emotionally damaged dogs, as they had no alternative but death.  This meant a lot of training, and work with a behaviourist, which is where the question comes from.

All the soft-eared dogs we sheltered carried their ears pressed back high on the skull, letting the tips fall loose, with the inside of the ear facing out, when relaxed.  When angry or stressed, their ears would be lower and pressed straight back, with the inside facing inward to the skull -- a quite  different placement.  

The behaviourist  insisted that *any* time a dog pressed its ears back it was unhappy/threatened.  Despite any progress the dogs made,  every visit consisted of her telling me how I was failing these dogs because they were so stressed.  Eventually, I just stopped going.

It's a decade later.  The dogs, now well adapted and trained,  still carry their ears folded at all times unless they are specifically interested in something right ahead of them, or I am talking with them:  then the ears are up and forward, like a collie.  As they age, I am wondering whether or not I've given them the best I could, and those ears still puzzle and, I admit, upset me.  Is it possible the street dogs of the Balkans simply have a different culture, one in which  laid back ears can communicate different things depending on the *way* in which they are laid back?  Is there research on dog postural communication that takes into account differing geographic/situational origins?  All I have been able to find looks at North American or Western European dogs who come from generations of domestic canines, while these are Eastern Europeans who come from generations of semi-feral, often abused dogs.

askscience,"So I understand that when I'm writing a linked list, and a node points to another node, it is the memory address where the first node is stored pointing to another. So like if you have a table of memory addresses, if the first node is stored at memory location n and the second node is stored at memory location k, you would just have to iterate (k-n) times through the table (from node n) to get to location k. However, I'd assume that in a real system, you may sometimes run into a problem where weirdly spaced blocks of this memory table have been allocated to other programs. More formally, if I have a memory demand of k memory units for some program x, and there is already an allocated block of memory for some program z starting at (address k minus some non-zero constant y) and ending at an address n s.t n&gt;k; will my memory assignment program try to reallocate the memory for z or will it split the memory for program x into blocks 1:(0,k-y) and 2:(n,k)? If it is the latter then doesn't that present a routing problem? As in if my memory circuit is laid out in vertical rows where the height of each row is (length of memory address table/number of rows), and i have a large gap between blocks 1 and 2(one that may even span multiple rows), at some point,I hypothesize that it may become quicker to traverse the memory circuit horizontally rather than to iterate through the entire block of program z-s allocated memory. 
TL;DR:
Can a memory circuit be visualized as a linked list? Does memory always reallocate? If it doesn't, does traversing the memory circuit linearly between referenced memory locations impose a demand on processing power? Why can't we (or do we) produce circuits where memory units are laid out in a ""complete graph"" configuration where every unit is connected to every other unit?","On the level of hardware, how do pointers work?",1

1.  He speaks about there being a divergence, duplication, or split of worlds when a wave function collapses.  He says that the other ""world"" exists in a different set of dimensions in Hilbert space.  (I think I'm understanding this correctly but please correct if wrong).  My question is, how does the duplication or split not require more energy than what was already contained within the particle?  How is there a duplication without the need for added energy?  If you don't need additional energy, wouldn't the resulting ""world's"" particle have less energy than the original one?
2. Once the wave function of the particle collapses, is it then always ""collapsed"" in all worlds? Or can it then split yet again?
3. How do we know that quantum particles are actually probabilistic instead of us just not understanding why they appear to behave that way?  Couldn't a fast enough oscillation between two states make it appear that a particle/wave function follows a given probability?
4. Does referring to these particles as ""wave functions"" mean that they are supposedly just mathematical principles floating around and not actual packets or energy or particles?  The way this subject is talked about makes it seem that the people studying this believe this to be the case.

Kinetic energy grows quadratically with velocity. This made sense to me until my friend suggested the following thought experiment:

In respect to each other, B and C are not moving. Now C accelerates to 20 m/s relative to A and 10 m/s relative to B. This increases C's kinetic energy to 4x. From B's perspective, this looks like an acceleration from 0 to 10 m/s but required 3x energy.

askscience,"It seems as though popular explanations of concepts like dark matter and dark energy come in the form of ""the best mathematical model we currently have to fit a set of observations, such as the cosmic background radiation and the apparent acceleration of inflation, imply that there must be far more matter and more energy than the matter and energy that we can observe, so we hypothesize the existence of various forms of dark matter and dark energy.""

This kind of explanation seems baffling. I would think that if a model doesn't account for all of the observations, such as *both* CBR and acceleration *and* the observed amount of matter and energy in the universe, then the most obvious hypothesis would not be that there must be matter and energy we can't observe, but that the mathematical model must be inaccurate. In other fields, if a model doesn't account for observations using methods that were themselves used to construct the model, it is far more natural to think that this would tend to suggest that the model is wrong or incomplete rather than that the observations are wrong or incomplete. 

There seems to be an implied rejoinder: the Standard Model of the universe is really accurate at mathematically formulating many observations and predicting many observations that were subsequently confirmed, and there is so far no better model, so we have reason to think that unobservable things implied by it actually exist unless someone can propose an even better mathematical model. This also seems baffling: why would the assumption be that reality conforms to a single consistent mathematical formulation discoverable by us or any mathematical formulation at all? Ordinarily we would think that math can represent idealized versions of the physical world but would not insist that the physical world conform itself to a mathematical model. For example, if we imagine handling a cylindrical container full of water, which we empty into vessel on the scale, if the weight of the of the water is less than that which would be predicted according to the interior measurements of the container and the cylinder volume equation, no one would think to look for 'light liquid,' they would just assume that the vessel wasn't a perfect cylinder, wasn't completely full of water, or for some other reason the equation they were using did not match the reality of the objects they were measuring. 

So this is puzzling to me.

It is also sufficiently obvious a question that I assume physicists have a coherent answer to it which I just haven't heard (I also haven't this question posed, but I'm not a physicist so it wouldn't necessarily come up).

askscience,"Say Bob has two choices, A and B, and he wants to let Alice know which one he's picked at time point t sooner than information travelling at the speed of light could get to her. To accomplish that, before they part ways, they produce many 3-qubit entanglements, each in a [GHZ state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state) \[i.e. in a superposition of (|000&gt; + |111&gt;)/sqrt(2)\]. Bob takes one of the involved particles from each entanglement with him while Alice keeps the other two per system. Their plan of communication is that if Alice, at a time point shortly after t, tests her pairs for entanglement with sufficient confidence, she will assume Bob chose A, otherwise B.

Light years apart, at time point t, Bob now selects one of the two options.  
If his choice falls on A, he leaves his particles undisturbed, so that Alice's test results soon after should still strongly suggest the entanglement of her respective pairs of particles. Which would lead her to suspect Bob selected A.  
If he goes for B, he measures all of his particles, collapsing the respective superpositions to either |000&gt; or |111&gt;, which are unentangled pure states. Alice's test for entanglement then likely reveals the new random nature in absence of entanglement (e.g. different spin directions when measured at certain angles). Her conclusion would be that Bob selected/sent B.

However, one day his son came home with terrible news: ""Dad, I've made up my mind I'm going vegetarian!""

Jokes,"A man gets home after leaving work early and finds his wife in bed with a stranger.

He silently grabs his pistol, making sure that he doesn't get noticed by his wife and her lover, and prepares to shoot them both.

Suddenly, a few thoughts come to his mind. He started to remember the previous six months.

&amp;nbsp;

For some reason, his wife stopped asking him for money to buy new clothes, yet every other week, she came home with new clothes, new shoes, new earrings.

Their kids stopped going to public school. This year, they started going to that fancy private school with a very good reputation.

The new car, yeah that's right, his wife got a new car. He always thought it was a little weird, given that he doesn't get a raise in nearly 5 years, he can barely save money for himself, and his income is supposed to be higher than hers, but he never really gave it any thought.

Now that he thinks about it, despite his shit income, he's been eating like a king these past few months. There has always been food at the table, good food, steak every week, quality wine every so often, the fridge is full, he's been eating pretty much what he wants when he wants.

Bills? He now remembers that he's not been seeing them for a while. For some reason, the bills stopped being a problem, and now that he thinks about it, he never got to question why.

Life has been very good.

&amp;nbsp;

He looks at his wife again, she's having sex with that stranger, a man he's never seen before in his life, shamelessly using his wife like she belongs to him, in that same bed he sleeps in.

Feelings of rage and disgust cloud his brain, he has the finger on the trigger, he's ready to shoot. But he starts thinking again.

&amp;nbsp;

The truth was that his wife was a bomb. She's well in her forties, yet her beauty remains the same as when she was young, that woman seems imune to aging, even after giving birth to 2 kids. She had a good pair of tits, a round delicious booty, and sex with her was simply amazing.

Hell, seeing her in action right now was just reinforcing the idea of how perfect she was in bed.

&amp;nbsp;

He stood there silent for one more minute, pointing his pistol at his wife and her lover, while reflecting on those thoughts.

Then, he silently puts his pistol back in its place, and slowly leaves the room, still careful so he doesn't get noticed.

He says to himself:

-The motherfucker pays for my wife's clothes, buys her a new car, pays for the kids private school, pays for the food so I get to eat like a king for free, and he even pays all our bills. Yet, at the end of the day, I still get to have passionate sex with my hot wife when I get home every day...

&amp;nbsp;

He closes the door behind him, and laughing, reaches the conclusion:

Jokes,"So, a few years ago, I met the owner of a multimillion dollar company, and he decided to tell me a very strange story.

The man told me that he had a son, for whom he cared about deeply, so much so that for his 15th birthday, he offered him anything he wanted in the world.

In response, the son said 
“Thank you father, but I believe I already have enough. I don’t require anything else... except maybe one thing...”

The father said
“Yes, anything! If you want it, it is yours! You just have to ask.”

The son replied
“Alright... I would like...a ping pong ball, please”

“A...ping pong ball?”

“Yes. More specifically, a green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong ball. Just one will do.”

The father was obviously confused, but did what his son asked. The next day, the son unwrapped his only present, and found the green pink and purple polka dot ping pong ball that he had asked for. He was delighted, and he took the ping pong ball up to his room, locking himself inside. After a few hours, the he emerged. The ping pong ball was gone. The boy never mentioned what he did with it, or why he wanted it.

One year later, and it’s the boys 16th birthday. Again, the father tells him that he can have anything he wants, he simply has to ask.

“Well father, you are very kind, but I believe I already have enough. I require nothing else... except maybe one thing.”

“Whatever you want, son”

“Well... I would like... a pack of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls, please.”

The father was again very confused, but again follows his sons wishes. The next morning, the son opened his only present, a pack of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls. Again, the boy was delighted, and again he took the pack of ping pong balls up to his room, locking himself inside. He emerged hours later. The pack of ping pong balls was gone. The boy never mentioned what he did with them, or why he wanted them.

One year later, and it’s the boys 17th birthday. The father offers him anything we wants, again”

“Father, I know I already have a lot, but... could I please have a pallet of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls?”

The father is beginning to see a trend, but nonetheless gets him what he wants. The next day, the boy opens his only present, a pallet of green, pink and purple ping pong balls. The boy was delighted as always, and he took the pallet of ping pong balls up to his room, locking himself inside. Hours later, he emerged. The pallet was gone. The boy never mentioned what he did with it, or why he wanted it.

One year later, and it’s the boys 18th birthday. Before the father can even make the offer, the boy says 

“A truck full of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls, please!”

The father is now seriously concerned, but nevertheless follows his sons wishes. The next day, a truck rolls up to the family mansion, filled with hundreds of pallets of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls. The boy is delighted, and as expected, he takes the truckload of ping pong ball up to his room, locking himself inside. Hours later, he emerges.
Every last pallet is gone. The boy never mentions what he did with them, or why he wanted them.

One year later, and it’s the boys 19th birthday.

“A warehouse of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls, please!”

At this point, the father is thinking about hiring a doctor, but nevertheless he follows his sons wishes. The next day, he takes his son to a warehouse filled with millions of pallets of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls. The son (as expected) is delighted, and he locks himself inside the warehouse. Hours later, he emerges, Every last pallet is gone. The boy never mentions what he did with them, or why he wanted them.

One year later, and it’s the day before the boys 20th birthday. He’s driving along the road, lost in the thought of the green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong ball factory he is going to ask for. In fact, he is so lost in thought that he misses a red light, and collides straight into another car.

The boy is taken to hospital. His injuries are severe. The nurses say he won’t have much longer to live. As he lies in the hospital bed, his father comes to visit him. 

“Oh no, my boy... my dear sweet boy...”

After a few minutes of crying, the father finally decides to ask

“My son... we both know you may not have much time left in this world... so please, answer me honestly... what did you do with those green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls?”

The son smiles

“Ah yes...those wonderful green.... purple... and pink polka dot... ping pong balls. Father, I think it’s time. I think that I’m going to tell you now. There’s no use hiding it any longer. You see, the reason I wanted those green, pink and purple polka dot ping balls... what I did with them... the truth is-“

Jokes,"Scientists’ initial findings on the new substance had lead them to believe it was highly explosive, however they simply could not determine what forces were to trigger this reaction.
They dropped it from the highest cliffs, and crushed it in the deepest oceans.
They tried igniting in it the sunniest of locations, and in the darkest of crevasses.
They subject it to the hottest temperatures they could muster, both natural and manmade.
And yet, the material was unwavering, refusing to yield to any force…until a scientist suggested the impossible.
“What if it only explodes when it’s really cold?”
Out they set to test the theory. Sure enough, as the temperature grew ever colder, the element began to show signs of degradation. Excitedly, they began pushing the temperatures even further into the freezing zone. As the temperatures reached nearer and nearer to 0 Kelvin (absolute cold), the element continued to increasingly react.
Finally, when the temperature reached approximately that of absolute zero, there was a blinding flash as the element exploded before their eyes, leaving a gaping hole on the laboratory bench.
As the applause from the team of scientists began to die down, relieved of finally solving the mystery, one of the senior scientists boldly asked, “so what do we name this newfound element?”.
Amongst the thought that ensued, one of the younger scientists was quick to make a suggestion...

Jokes,"There was a little boy who lived in a far away land. Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.  


Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there.  


One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  


So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  


The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.  


As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  


So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  


The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.  


As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  


So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  


The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.  


As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.  


So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.  


""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.  


That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.  


The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.  


He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.  


""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""  


""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""  


""Well, then can I become a monk?""  


""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""  


So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.  


""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk.""  


So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.  


""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.  


The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""  


""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""  


Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end.  


Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!  


Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.  


""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""  


""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""  


The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.  


Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor.

He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery.

""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""  


The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.  


Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.  


Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.  


Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!  


Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!  


Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!  


He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.  


Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside.  


Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!

He claps his hands and a beautiful blonde woman appears out of the front door. She is wearing tight closing and looks absolutely stunning. 

Only a few seconds later, the first bell is heard. The priest, red with shame, pulls his pants up and leaves the room.

The woman then proceeds to strip slowly. Very quickly, a lot of bells are heard and a lot of priests leave the room ashamed.

Now completely naked, the woman starts to approach the remaining priests, while caressing her breasts. Out of the 4 remaining priests, 3 get aroused and are excused. The bishop is seething but focuses on the remaining priest.

My mum tells this joke and she swears it's the funniest joke ever. However the rest of the family don't get it. I feel like she has forgotten an element or something. Here is the joke.

2 troubled boys are told that they have to behave or santa won't bring them gifts. Their behaviour improves and their mum buys them presents. To avoid them finding them pre Christmas she finds them behind a wall mounted moose head. 

Come Christmas day, their mum forgets where she hid the gifts (or maybe she died, or was otherwise unable to give them the gifts). The boys decide behaving well isn't worth it and they turn to a life of crime.

Years later, in a police chase/ shootout situation, the two boys find themselves escaping into the family home. The house is shaken up by the entrance of the police, dislodging the moose head. Gifts come out.

The boys exclaim ""There's been a huge mistake!""

I picked one up and my buddy goes ""are they heavy?"", so i try to guess the weight, you know, add to the i'm just looking around act i'm pulling off, slowly raising and lowering it. I pick up another one, now i have two, counter balancing them to guess the weight.

However, he walks in the Subway and quickly finds that the sub, oddly named Arjoques, is completely identical to a sandwich he had purchased at Jimmy John's only a day before, comprised of common meats and cheeses he had eaten many times before.

The man then recalls that a Subway in a city nearby had recently been involved in a scandal, in which they were accused of stealing ingredients from a nearby warehouse to cut costs.

Upset but hungry, he purchases the sub. After taking the sandwich from the bag, an equally disapproving worker comes up to him and says ""Sorry sir, but the Arjoques sub doesn't have any original contents. Everything in here is stolen.""",A man walks into a Subway...,0

Jokes,"My bedroom is very small. It's pokey. Like a deluxe room at a Japanese pod hotel. Everything has to be very tidy and in its place to make it look like I don't sleep in a charity shop store room, where they keep all surplus stock not good enough to have out on the racks.

I sleep on a top bunk bed because I stripped the bottom bunk out to make space for my piano and cupboards. Total walking space in my bedroom - a modest 3m². Ideal for moments of circular contemplation.

I was telling my boss about all this recently. She's a lovely woman. Very thoughtful and accommodating, appreciative, caring and happy. And she likes to enjoy a nice craft beer at the end of the day.

I was telling her about the miserly amount of sleeping space I get in my bunk bed, because it's made of metal and has a headboard and feetboard(?) which locks my 6'4"" body inside a 6'3"" frame. So most nights I sleep like an unmotivated starfish. If its proper baltic and the metal feetboard feels like ice on my toes then I will sleep fetal - but I prefer not be scrunched up.

My boss listened attentively to my tales of woe, which must have been very boring for her.

I moaned about the unsatisfactory dimensions of UK bunk beds, and how successive generations of kids are generally taller than the last, but bunk bed lengths hadn't reflected this trend in child growth.

Then I instantly ruined all sympathy in the air by talking about the perfect length a mattress would have to be for me, by asserting to my boss - ""If I want to feel completely relaxed in bed then I'd need at least 4 inches to play with"".",How to ruin sympathy fast,0

Jokes," 

My grandfather was always playing pranks on people. He was originally from Ireland before he moved to the US. He fit all of the stereotypes of an Irishman, having red hair and beard, constantly being at the bar, and having an accent so thick that I could barely understand him even though I knew him for years.

In addition to all these traits, grandpa was a rather short man. Everyone he met called him a leprechaun, always asking him for his pot of gold or his Lucky Charms. They even called him a leprechaun while he still lived in Ireland, saying he was the spitting image of one.

At first, he was annoyed, just wanting to get a drink without the hassle. But after a while, he began to take advantage of the name. He was always getting people at the bar to do stupid stuff for a chance at a pot of gold. After all, it isn't that hard to convince a drunk person that a short Irish ginger is an actual leprechaun.

He was doing this for decades, and without fail there would always be at least one person at the bar he frequents that would try to get a pot of gold.

Many years passed, and grandpa started to go to the bar less and less. He said since he was getting older, he would much rather stay at home and watch whatever is on the television instead of going out to bars, getting drunk and playing pranks.

A few years later, grandpa was hospitalized. Doctors said it was his liver failing. Even though he stopped drinking recently, all the decades of abuse his liver took have finally caught up to him. Instead of being horrified or worried, grandpa looked peaceful, almost relieved. He began to calmly write his will, giving his possessions away to family members.

For most people, he wrote down normal items, like his car, television, or house. But he gave me something very different. Instead of including it in his will, he decided to give it to me in person when there was nobody else around.

""Listen,"" be began to say to me, ""I need to tell you something very important. All those years of joking about being a leprechaun... those were not jokes. I really am a leprechaun. Here, take this."" he said, handing me what looks like a small lump of metal. ""That, my boy, is my pot of gold. It might not look like much now, but if you place it down at the end of a rainbow, it will explode into a shower of golden coins. It's very important that you tell nobody about this.""

Of course, I thought he was just pulling another prank, like he has all these years before. But honestly, what do I have to lose? The next time I found a rainbow, I placed the metal at the end of it. I'm waiting for something to happen as I'm writing this, I'll keep you updated.

Edit: Wow, this really blew up! Thanks for the gold!",My grandfather was always playing pranks on people.,0
