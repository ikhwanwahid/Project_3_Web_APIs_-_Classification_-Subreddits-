"since 2015 using nasa hardware scientists and researchers have worked with astronauts on the international space station to conduct a series of experiments to grow harvest and eat a variety of crops in space with seeds sent from earth the most recent experiment has the iss crew growing mizuna mustard using two different light recipes and multiple harvests with the experiments final harvest scheduled for later this week this work builds upon decades of nasa and international research into growing plants in space

these experiments are advancing the knowledge required to successfully grow a large variety of crops on longduration missions such as a crewed mission to mars being able to crops grown in space provides many benefits including supplementing the astronauts packaged diet with essential nutrients and combating diet fatigue

i am always confused be centrifugal and centripetal force i am just going to state my thinking and help me point out the problem at the equator your body is traveling fast in a circle and the inertia of your body makes you continue to move outword this is the centrifugal force at the poles you are moving not at all or much slower in a circle so your inertia has less effect with less outword force the normal force or your wieght would have to compensate so you would weigh more at the equator the centrifugal force lessons your weight  not mass  because it helps counteract gravity,do you weigh less at the equator because of centrifugal force,1
if the universe is infused with dark matter would it not have become clumpy due to gravity just like normal matter did forming superclusters galaxies stars etc and therefore would there not be black holes that formed as clumps of dark matter collapsed with very little matter nearby,could there possibly be black holes that formed from collapsing dark matter,1

for the earth and the moon the ratio of mass between the moon and the earth is so weighted on earths side that the moon goes in orbit around the centre of mass of the earth however suppose that we have two bodies that are similar in mass and size is it possible for a configuration to exist where there is an imaginary centre of orbit that lies on a straight line between the two planets centre of gravity that they both orbit around on opposite sides

my intuition is that this would require hidden variables to work since the wave function does not contain enough information to predict when a particle will decay beause the decay time is not a property of the wave function there would be no part of the particles wave function that could be entangled to ensure that they decay at the same time but i could easily have overlooked something so im asking to be sure,can two unstable particles be in an entangled state that causes their decay to be synchronized,1

the idea that the brain can function after losing 50 of its matter also brings up a lot of questions id love to know the answer to is the brain simply not as efficient as it could be in normal people and thats why one half that is i assume more efficient can compensate so well if so is this the reason why there is a such an immense difference between people is the brain of a genius simply more like the remaining half of someone who went through a hemispherectomy are most brains simply stupid compared to what they could be if they reached their full potential

im asking this because we talked about 2 experiments in class that seemed to contradict each other

another experiment used chip and concluded that rnap could only bind to the promoter when the repressor was not bound to the operator

it sounds pedantic but as i understand it a better description would be that w0 matter adds to expansion in a way that decreases with a and therefore time and so in a matter dominated universe the expansion slows but doesnt stop see the at23 equation or whatever due to as increasing not directly due to that matter  this makes a difference as when i was taught it the reductive dark matter slows expansion statement misled me greatly

hello ive recently been creating a fantasy map and was looking up atolls and ive several questions about them

the first is why are there so few atolls in the atlantic only off the coast of belize while the pacific ocean and the indian ocean are chalk full of them i presume this is due to lack of volcanic activity in the atlantic ocean in area where reefs can form but then that leads to another question about the lack of volcanic hotspots in the atlantic

the second question i have is the removal of the former island that the coral reef rings around how does this precisely happen i recall watching a video where it was stated that the weight of the reef somehow has something to do with it or is it more to do with erosion wouldnt a barrier reef prevent erosion to a degree

and the last question i have is concerning the make up of islands since new caldonia gt40mya is older geologically speaking than midway island 27mya and the two are completely different one is an atoll the other is a proper island which is a roundabout way of asking is the geological makeup of an atoll more prone to erosion than a regular island",location of atolls atlantic vs pacific and several other atoll related questions,1

i realize one of the major problems with taking antibiotics is that it also kills healthy bacteria in the gut microbiota so it got me thinking if stopping antibiotic treatment early can lead to antibiotic resistant bacteria would the same logic also apply to good bacteria if we worked out a correct probiotic supplement regime could the law of probability allow good bacteria to eventually colonize to a level whereby antibiotic resistance to things like amoxicillin could be achieved thus negating many side effects of antibiotics and their effect on the gut microbiota,could beneficial bacteria from probiotics form antibiotic resistance too,1

after reading a thread earlier about viruses i was reminded of something i read a long time ago but i cant for the life of me remember what it was and my searches are turning up nothing 

i remembered reading about some microorganism i dont want to call it a virusbacteriaparasite because im not sure if that would be accurate given the discussion i remember being that it was an outlier so to speak 

it was something along the lines of it didnt use dnarna for its genetic code or had no common ancestor like everything else i do remember it sparked theories of extraterrestrial origin possibly dropped by a meteor or was the original life on earth before something supplied what became life as we know it now if that makes sense or it was beat out by dnarna or it was some divergent phenomenon i cant recall

"hey askscience id need help from some people that know a little in genetics

in general since x and y chromosomes arent homologous the y one being smaller crossingovers cant happen between then 

in any way i read in some science magazines that the x and the y chromosomes still have some homologous parts between them so would this mean that a crossingover would happen 

ampx200b

background info  in bio class we had a test on genetics the subject was on the color of a cats robe which depends on 2 allelles from x chromosomes eumelanin that codes a black fur and phreomelanin that codes an orange fur plenty of female cats have a tortie fur a mix of both colours since they have 2 x chromosomes our aim was to show how certain male cats could have a tortie robe

the main answer was a trisomy after during anaphase i so one of the cells had 2x chrs one with the xn allelle and on with xr allelle if this cell had children there could be one with xrxny which would be a male tortie

if the loci of xn and xr arent the same there can be a crossingover between the 2xs leading to one x having both allelles and the male descendant would also be tortie

but if the loci of the allelles werent specified in the test subject we can perfectly extrapolate if the x and y chromosomes have only a small homologuous part there can be a crossingover between them even really unlikely so one allelle is on the y chromosome and a descendant could be xnyr or xryn 

my teacher is really stubborn she only believes in the magazine nature but any renowned scientific could be ok

can any of you help me on this subject

"from wikipedia

gt to a distant observer clocks near a black hole would appear to tick more slowly than those further away from the black hole78 due to this effect known as gravitational time dilation an object falling into a black hole appears to slow as it approaches the event horizon taking an infinite time to reach it

how does this work in terms of  us nonetheless observing that black holes do consume matter and gain mass

and conversely if from our reference frame nothing ever actually falls into the event horizon but approaches it over infinite time then how does the black hole information theory paradox arise do we not then see an imprint of all matter at the edge of the event horizon",if objects take an infinite time to fall into a black hole from our frame of reference then how to black holes gain mass from our frame of reference,1

"in a 4 stroke engine during the compression stroke a gasolineair mixture is compressed inside the combustion chamber this decrease in volume leads to an increase in pressure which in turn leads to an increase in temperature i understand that the increased temperature leads to better fuel vaporization for the same reason that boiling a pot of water will increase the vaporization of that water however the pressure is also increasing  doesnt that work against the goal of increasing the fuel vaporization in other words doesnt the increased pressure work to condense the fuel out of vapor and into droplets 

maybe both of these forces are acting on the fuel but the temperature increase has a larger effect and wins out causing more vaporization to occur than the pressure increase causes condensation how is the amount of vaporization even measured

ive been trying to figure out exactly how a compression stroke in an engine increases the engines efficiency ive found many articlesposts about the effect of the increase in temperature but nothing mentioning the condensing effects of increased pressure

as a tangent if i take a sealed disposable water bottle with a few droplets of water in it and i twist it like thishttpsapictureofvancouveradayfileswordpresscom201109twistedwaterbottlejpg to increase the pressure inside the temperature will increase if i then leave the bottle untouched for a while so that the heat dissipates and it returns to room temperature then there will be fewer water molecules in a gaseous state compared to before i twisted the bottle is that correct",why does the compression of fuelair in an engine increase vaporization,1

"so as i understand it vapor pressure is the pressure inside a container when the liquid has evaporated enough to fully saturate the rest of the container and it reaches a equilibrium this is what gives some aerosol cans their consistent pressure when a liquid like butane evaporates at is vapor pressure to fill the space when using a can this is also why a cold can has less pressure because the vapor pressure is lower correct

where as the critical point is when a liquid and its vapor coexist in equilibrium and it becomes super critical above this point where the gas and liquid are basically the same density 

so what exactly is the difference if c02 has a vapor pressure of 350 kpa at 25c as i understand then why is the supercritical point 7380 kpa at 31c when both would be a liquid and a gas in a container i dont understand the differences between the two

at higher altitudes all the way out to space the tuc is only a handful of seconds

why

intuitively i completely understand that the loss of partial o2 pressure will make my breathing inefficient but even assuming the worst case that i cant receive any new oxygen from the atmosphere i should be able at least to match my apnea performance at sea level using the oxygen i already have in my bloodstream

would it be possible for someone with adhd to also have a condition that results in elevated norepinephrine such as hyperpots pheochromocytoma or chronic stress im pretty sure that chronic stress doesnt cure adhd but wouldnt it balance out your levels if they were already low a sudden scare can trigger a release of epinephrinenorepinephrine adreneline rush but i dont think that purposely scaring adhd people helps them focus

conditions that increase norepinephrine specifically hyperpots and pheochromocytoma are partially diagnosed by a blood test to test the norepinephrine levels in the blood xhttpswwwhealthlinecomhealthcatecholaminesblood if a blood test can accurately find out if there is too much norepinephrine why cant a blood test that tests for low levels be used to diagnose adhd

a few months ago my dad and i were camping in the middle of nowhere in queensland australia there was no major light pollution for at least 60 kilometres so we could see a lot of the stars and astronomical stuff around 9 pm we were sitting there looking at it all and i noticed a cloud nothing strange so i took no notice of it it was a moderately windy night so when i looked back at it 20 minutes later and it hasnt moved i was naturally curious i asked him if it was one of those huge masses of gas in space and he said it probably wasnt and he wasnt exactly sure what it was he did a lot of science and mathematics in university so i trusted him i am also relatively knowledgeable in physics brag but i couldnt think of what it could be i forgot about it and then we went to bed tent at 11 pmish at 3 am i got up to go pee and it was in the exact same spot as when i saw it hours ago even though the rest of the starts and gas masses had shifted around at that point i realised that it had to be in our atmosphere or spinning with the earth at least because it hadnt moved it also definitely couldnt have been a cloud or anything physically light because at that time it was insanely windy at sea level so i couldnt imagine what it would be like that far up still now months later i have no idea what it could have been does anyone in the entire rscience community have an idea its been killing me ever since i saw it,weird permanent thing in the sky,1

"this might have an obvious answer so i apologize in advance but i am researching string theory for a project and i thought of this question

if closed strings can move through different universes doesnt that violate the law of conservation of energy in our universe sure energy is used to make that string maybe a big bang from another universe or something but if it did not originate from our universe and energy from our universe was not used to create it then our universe just had an increase in its total energymass or on the other hand if a closed stringed particle created by our big bang leaves our universe then our universe lost some of its total energy but both ways this means that the universe isnt actually an isolated system because energy entered the universe or the law of conservation was violated for a split second i know string theory is just a theory but i want to know how it works with the theories and laws we already have in place thanks in advance and im sorry if this question is hard to follow lmao",does string theory violate the law of conservation of energy or is the universe not an isolated system,1
i heard somewhere that at low energies superstring theory reduces to a version of bransdicke which is basically general relativity with an extra scalar field instead of the gravitational constant g if this is true then if we can determine a decent value of ω wont that help narrow down the string theory landscape im curious about this kind of approach because it sounds like we might not get any experimental evidence for string theory at the quantum scale any time soon but perhaps theres a way at much larger scales,has there been any progress of pinning down the free parameters of generalizations of general relativity like bransdicke or kaluzaklein so that we can actually calculate with them,1

"botanical dietary supplements sometimes called herbals or herbal dietary supplements and essential oils are products made from plants plant parts or plant extracts one study found that natural products including botanical dietary supplements are used by approximately 15 of adultshttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed29211315 and are widely available in the united states in fact according to the american botanical councilhttpcmsherbalgramorgpress20192018herbmarketreporthtml americans spent a total of 88 billion on botanical dietary supplements in 2018

but just because a product is from a plant source and sold in stores or online doesntt mean its safe the safety of a botanical or essential oil depends on many things such as its chemical makeup how it works in the body how it is prepared and the dose used

the amount of scientific evidence available for various botanical supplement ingredients varies widely in part because product safety is not tested by fda and federal law does not require dietary supplements be tested for effectiveness before they are marketed

studying the potential effects of botanical dietary supplements has several unique challenges for example all botanical dietary supplements contain a complex mixture of ingredients making it difficult to identify and link active ingredients to health effects growing harvesting and processing conditions can also affect the chemical makeup of a botanical supplement leading to challenges in manufacturing identical products batch after batch possible contaminants  either accidental or intentional via adulteration  in botanical dietary supplements eg heavy metals microbes undeclared ingredients or pesticides needs to be
determined as part of routine quality control since these can affect its safety

"in some theories of expansion the extremely fast expansion in the early universe can be explained by a field in a unique false vacuum highenergy state  from my understanding its called a false vacuum because even though it was relatively stable like a true vacuum there were large energy discrepancies between this field and the other field

the energy in this field eventually distributed itself into other fields resulting in the creation of particles and slowing down  expansion  some theorists also posit that dark energy is coming from a similar source  a highenergy field in a false vacuum   some theorists go further to suggest the idea of vacuum collapse where this darkenergy field redistributes its energy resulting in a redefinition of all particles

my question is thus do these theories make any claims about an absolute zero for a quantum field or is all energy in a quantum field relative  we are able to measure the energy in these theoretical fields due to their effect on our universe but is this measure of energy an absolute measure or is it just a measuring energy discrepancy

to take it a step further is there anything in qft that would stop me positing the existence of another unknown field that could serve as an energy sink for this current universe  i mean obviously there is no proof that this field exists  we would need to see some sort of observable effect on our universe in order to begin seriously entertaining the idea  but im wondering if there are any theoretical concepts that pin down negative relative to our current universe qft energies",is the vacuum state of a field in qft relative or absolute,1

"we ran a shelter for balkan street dogs  as i had little knowledge of dogs up to that point i assumed what i learned from these dogs was how dogs were  when we returned home we brought two emotionally damaged dogs as they had no alternative but death  this meant a lot of training and work with a behaviourist which is where the question comes from

all the softeared dogs we sheltered carried their ears pressed back high on the skull letting the tips fall loose with the inside of the ear facing out when relaxed  when angry or stressed their ears would be lower and pressed straight back with the inside facing inward to the skull  a quite  different placement  

the behaviourist  insisted that any time a dog pressed its ears back it was unhappythreatened  despite any progress the dogs made  every visit consisted of her telling me how i was failing these dogs because they were so stressed  eventually i just stopped going

its a decade later  the dogs now well adapted and trained  still carry their ears folded at all times unless they are specifically interested in something right ahead of them or i am talking with them  then the ears are up and forward like a collie  as they age i am wondering whether or not ive given them the best i could and those ears still puzzle and i admit upset me  is it possible the street dogs of the balkans simply have a different culture one in which  laid back ears can communicate different things depending on the way in which they are laid back  is there research on dog postural communication that takes into account differing geographicsituational origins  all i have been able to find looks at north american or western european dogs who come from generations of domestic canines while these are eastern europeans who come from generations of semiferal often abused dogs

2 once the wave function of the particle collapses is it then always collapsed in all worlds or can it then split yet again
3 how do we know that quantum particles are actually probabilistic instead of us just not understanding why they appear to behave that way  couldnt a fast enough oscillation between two states make it appear that a particlewave function follows a given probability
4 does referring to these particles as wave functions mean that they are supposedly just mathematical principles floating around and not actual packets or energy or particles  the way this subject is talked about makes it seem that the people studying this believe this to be the case

"a friend and i have trouble making sense of a very basic fact of newtonian physics
kinetic energy grows quadratically with velocity this made sense to me until my friend suggested the following thought experiment
3 bodies a b and c rest next to each other not affected by any forces a stays still while b and c accelerate to say 10 ms gaining an amount of kinetic energy x in respect to each other b and c are not moving now c accelerates to 20 ms relative to a and 10 ms relative to b this increases cs kinetic energy to 4x from bs perspective this looks like an acceleration from 0 to 10 ms but required 3x energy
it seems like as perspective is more correct than bs but why if velocity is always measured relative to an inertial system why is kinetic energy not where are my friend and i messing things up",how does kinetic energy make sense from different inertial systems,1
the crux of the recent storyhttpscleantechnicacom20191020ukmaninventsaluminumairbatteryinhisgarage about the uk engineer and his aluminum air battery was that such batteries have been known for a long time but required a toxic corrosive electrolyte so his breakthrough that he spent two decades searching for is an alternative electrolyte that works for the battery and is harmless enough to drink  my question is when any chemist is searching for a replacement chemical like this what guides the search  is it things like number of valence electrons molecular mass bond length simulations or what,what does the search for an alternative chemical look like,1
"im reading some science fiction where two earthlike planets of the same size are only slightly outside of each others orbit and have similar orbital periods so similar life forms move back and forth between each planet

i wasnt sure if this is possible would the two planets just collide",is it possible for a solar system to have two planets of the same size within the habitable goldilocks zone,1
"it seems as though popular explanations of concepts like dark matter and dark energy come in the form of the best mathematical model we currently have to fit a set of observations such as the cosmic background radiation and the apparent acceleration of inflation imply that there must be far more matter and more energy than the matter and energy that we can observe so we hypothesize the existence of various forms of dark matter and dark energy

this kind of explanation seems baffling i would think that if a model doesnt account for all of the observations such as both cbr and acceleration and the observed amount of matter and energy in the universe then the most obvious hypothesis would not be that there must be matter and energy we cant observe but that the mathematical model must be inaccurate in other fields if a model doesnt account for observations using methods that were themselves used to construct the model it is far more natural to think that this would tend to suggest that the model is wrong or incomplete rather than that the observations are wrong or incomplete 

there seems to be an implied rejoinder the standard model of the universe is really accurate at mathematically formulating many observations and predicting many observations that were subsequently confirmed and there is so far no better model so we have reason to think that unobservable things implied by it actually exist unless someone can propose an even better mathematical model this also seems baffling why would the assumption be that reality conforms to a single consistent mathematical formulation discoverable by us or any mathematical formulation at all ordinarily we would think that math can represent idealized versions of the physical world but would not insist that the physical world conform itself to a mathematical model for example if we imagine handling a cylindrical container full of water which we empty into vessel on the scale if the weight of the of the water is less than that which would be predicted according to the interior measurements of the container and the cylinder volume equation no one would think to look for light liquid they would just assume that the vessel wasnt a perfect cylinder wasnt completely full of water or for some other reason the equation they were using did not match the reality of the objects they were measuring 

so this is puzzling to me

it is also sufficiently obvious a question that i assume physicists have a coherent answer to it which i just havent heard i also havent this question posed but im not a physicist so it wouldnt necessarily come up 

could someone provide that answer or set of answers

thank you",why do cosmologists hypothesize the existence of unobservable matter or forces to fit standard model predictions instead of assuming that the standard model is like classical mechanics incomplete,1

"i understand that observing increased density further back in time together with redshift of light make up a valid foundation for the theory of expansion of the visible universe however we cannot see all the way back as i understand it it isnt even theoretically possible to obeserve anything from when our universe was to dense for light to propagate exist we do in effect have a wall at the edge of the universe we cannot see through and thus cannot observe all the way back even with better technology

so why do we interpolate the observed expansion of the observable universe all the way back to a point could it not be that it existed in some other larger states

"say bob has two choices a and b and he wants to let alice know which one hes picked at time point t sooner than information travelling at the speed of light could get to her to accomplish that before they part ways they produce many 3qubit entanglements each in a ghz statehttpsenwikipediaorgwikigreenbergere28093hornee28093zeilinger_state ie in a superposition of 000gt  111gtsqrt2 bob takes one of the involved particles from each entanglement with him while alice keeps the other two per system their plan of communication is that if alice at a time point shortly after t tests her pairs for entanglement with sufficient confidence she will assume bob chose a otherwise b

light years apart at time point t bob now selects one of the two options  
if his choice falls on a he leaves his particles undisturbed so that alices test results soon after should still strongly suggest the entanglement of her respective pairs of particles which would lead her to suspect bob selected a  
if he goes for b he measures all of his particles collapsing the respective superpositions to either 000gt or 111gt which are unentangled pure states alices test for entanglement then likely reveals the new random nature in absence of entanglement eg different spin directions when measured at certain angles her conclusion would be that bob selectedsent b

kurt noticed the man sending letter after letter day by day for months his curiosity got the better of him after some time and he decided to read one of the letters before delivering it he was astounded at how useful the mans advice was and decided this was worth sharing with everyone so he called up a local newspaper company

the newspaper company sent a reporter to come speak with kurt who told them a man sent the same letter every day for months to his daughter who never answered the letters read the letter it has some very good information that could help the whole world out

the reporter instead of being interested in what the letter said was interested in the mans dedication of sending the same letter every day to someone who never responded the reporter wrote an article and sent it to kurt to look at before publishing

"a man gets home after leaving work early and finds his wife in bed with a stranger

he silently grabs his pistol making sure that he doesnt get noticed by his wife and her lover and prepares to shoot them both

suddenly a few thoughts come to his mind he started to remember the previous six months

ampnbsp

for some reason his wife stopped asking him for money to buy new clothes yet every other week she came home with new clothes new shoes new earrings

their kids stopped going to public school this year they started going to that fancy private school with a very good reputation

the new car yeah thats right his wife got a new car he always thought it was a little weird given that he doesnt get a raise in nearly 5 years he can barely save money for himself and his income is supposed to be higher than hers but he never really gave it any thought

now that he thinks about it despite his shit income hes been eating like a king these past few months there has always been food at the table good food steak every week quality wine every so often the fridge is full hes been eating pretty much what he wants when he wants

bills he now remembers that hes not been seeing them for a while for some reason the bills stopped being a problem and now that he thinks about it he never got to question why

life has been very good

ampnbsp

he looks at his wife again shes having sex with that stranger a man hes never seen before in his life shamelessly using his wife like she belongs to him in that same bed he sleeps in

feelings of rage and disgust cloud his brain he has the finger on the trigger hes ready to shoot but he starts thinking again

ampnbsp

the truth was that his wife was a bomb shes well in her forties yet her beauty remains the same as when she was young that woman seems imune to aging even after giving birth to 2 kids she had a good pair of tits a round delicious booty and sex with her was simply amazing

hell seeing her in action right now was just reinforcing the idea of how perfect she was in bed

ampnbsp

he stood there silent for one more minute pointing his pistol at his wife and her lover while reflecting on those thoughts

then he silently puts his pistol back in its place and slowly leaves the room still careful so he doesnt get noticed

he says to himself

the motherfucker pays for my wifes clothes buys her a new car pays for the kids private school pays for the food so i get to eat like a king for free and he even pays all our bills yet at the end of the day i still get to have passionate sex with my hot wife when i get home every day

ampnbsp

he closes the door behind him and laughing reaches the conclusion

"so a few years ago i met the owner of a multimillion dollar company and he decided to tell me a very strange story

the man told me that he had a son for whom he cared about deeply so much so that for his 15th birthday he offered him anything he wanted in the world

in response the son said 
thank you father but i believe i already have enough i dont require anything else except maybe one thing

the father said
yes anything if you want it it is yours you just have to ask

the son replied
alright i would likea ping pong ball please

aping pong ball

yes more specifically a green pink and purple polka dot ping pong ball just one will do

the father was obviously confused but did what his son asked the next day the son unwrapped his only present and found the green pink and purple polka dot ping pong ball that he had asked for he was delighted and he took the ping pong ball up to his room locking himself inside after a few hours the he emerged the ping pong ball was gone the boy never mentioned what he did with it or why he wanted it

one year later and its the boys 16th birthday again the father tells him that he can have anything he wants he simply has to ask

well father you are very kind but i believe i already have enough i require nothing else except maybe one thing

whatever you want son

well i would like a pack of green pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls please

the father was again very confused but again follows his sons wishes the next morning the son opened his only present a pack of green pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls again the boy was delighted and again he took the pack of ping pong balls up to his room locking himself inside he emerged hours later the pack of ping pong balls was gone the boy never mentioned what he did with them or why he wanted them

one year later and its the boys 17th birthday the father offers him anything we wants again

father i know i already have a lot but could i please have a pallet of green pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls

the father is beginning to see a trend but nonetheless gets him what he wants the next day the boy opens his only present a pallet of green pink and purple ping pong balls the boy was delighted as always and he took the pallet of ping pong balls up to his room locking himself inside hours later he emerged the pallet was gone the boy never mentioned what he did with it or why he wanted it

one year later and its the boys 18th birthday before the father can even make the offer the boy says 

a truck full of green pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls please

the father is now seriously concerned but nevertheless follows his sons wishes the next day a truck rolls up to the family mansion filled with hundreds of pallets of green pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls the boy is delighted and as expected he takes the truckload of ping pong ball up to his room locking himself inside hours later he emerges
every last pallet is gone the boy never mentions what he did with them or why he wanted them

one year later and its the boys 19th birthday

a warehouse of green pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls please

at this point the father is thinking about hiring a doctor but nevertheless he follows his sons wishes the next day he takes his son to a warehouse filled with millions of pallets of green pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls the son as expected is delighted and he locks himself inside the warehouse hours later he emerges every last pallet is gone the boy never mentions what he did with them or why he wanted them

one year later and its the day before the boys 20th birthday hes driving along the road lost in the thought of the green pink and purple polka dot ping pong ball factory he is going to ask for in fact he is so lost in thought that he misses a red light and collides straight into another car

the boy is taken to hospital his injuries are severe the nurses say he wont have much longer to live as he lies in the hospital bed his father comes to visit him 

oh no my boy my dear sweet boy

after a few minutes of crying the father finally decides to ask

my son we both know you may not have much time left in this world so please answer me honestly what did you do with those green pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls

the son smiles

ah yesthose wonderful green purple and pink polka dot ping pong balls father i think its time i think that im going to tell you now theres no use hiding it any longer you see the reason i wanted those green pink and purple polka dot ping balls what i did with them the truth is

and then the boy dies

"scientists initial findings on the new substance had lead them to believe it was highly explosive however they simply could not determine what forces were to trigger this reaction
they dropped it from the highest cliffs and crushed it in the deepest oceans
they tried igniting in it the sunniest of locations and in the darkest of crevasses
they subject it to the hottest temperatures they could muster both natural and manmade
and yet the material was unwavering refusing to yield to any forceuntil a scientist suggested the impossible
what if it only explodes when its really cold
out they set to test the theory sure enough as the temperature grew ever colder the element began to show signs of degradation excitedly they began pushing the temperatures even further into the freezing zone as the temperatures reached nearer and nearer to 0 kelvin absolute cold the element continued to increasingly react
finally when the temperature reached approximately that of absolute zero there was a blinding flash as the element exploded before their eyes leaving a gaping hole on the laboratory bench

"there was a little boy who lived in a far away land close to the boys home there was a tall mountain always covered in snow at the top also at the top of the mountain there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived  


sometimes the little boy as he was riding his tricycle around his yard would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there  


one day when the wind was blowing down off the mountain the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind it was coming from the monastery he could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious  


so the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery it took him hours and hours but he finally made it to the top he bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door  


hello mr monk sir down at my home in the valley below i heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery could you tell me what it is  


im sorry replied the head monk i cant tell you you arent a monk  


sadly the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home in a very foul and frustrated mood he really did want to know what was making that noise  


the wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later the boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle  


as luck would have it he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain the air turned quite cold and he heard a very strange noise on the wind it was coming from the monastery he could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious  


so the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery it took him hours but he finally made it to the top he pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door  


hey mr monk down at my home in the valley below i heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery could you tell me what it is  


im sorry replied the head monk i cant tell you you arent a monk  


sadly the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home in a very foul and frustrated mood he really did want to know what was making that noise  


the wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later the boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle  


as luck would have it he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain the air turned quite cold and he heard a very strange noise on the wind it was coming from the monastery he could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious  


so the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery it took him 30 minutes but he finally made it to the top he pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door  


yo mr monk dude down at my home in the valley below i heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery could you tell me what it is  


im sorry replied the head monk i cant tell you you arent a monk  


sadly the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home in a very foul and frustrated mood he really did want to know what was making that noise  


the wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later the boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar  


as luck would have it he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain the air turned quite cold and he heard a very strange noise on the wind it was coming from the monastery he could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious  


so the young man bought a burger at a fast food place got in his convertible sportscar and started his ride up to the monastery it took him 20 minutes but he finally made it to the top he pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door  


mr monk down at my home in the valley below i heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery could you tell me what it is  


im sorry replied the head monk i cant tell you you arent a monk  


sadly the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home in a very foul and frustrated mood he really did want to know what was making that noise  


that night he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it so he resolved to do something about it the next day  


the next day he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain slammed on his brakes and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery  


he honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door  


alright mr monk i want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery  


im sorry replied the head monk i cant tell you you arent a monk  


well then can i become a monk  


why certainly it is quite easy you must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach when you return with your answer then you shall be a monk  


so the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth for years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand until one day he had finally finished he made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk  


oh mr monk i have travelled the earth these past years counting the blades of grass and grains of sand i finally know that there are 123123123123123 blades of grass in the fields and 123123123123123 grains of sand on the beaches and i would like to become a monk  


so the man became a monk at last he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery  


mr monk what is the noise coming from the monastery asked the new monk  


the head monk replied the source is too complicated to describe in words i am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it this key will show you the answer you seek  


take this key to the deepest darkest corner of the coldest dampest room in the dirtiest filthiest cavern under the monastery there you will find a long corridor at the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise  


well of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest darkest corner of the coldest dampest room in the dirtiest filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor he walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end  


unfortunately there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door he decided to jump the fires to reach the door the man made sure the key was secure in his hand took a running charge at the first fire and leapt  


over the first fire he flew but he dropped the key the man leapt back over the fire ran all the way back down the long corridor out of the deepest darkest corner of the coldest dampest room in the dirtiest filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk  


oh mr monk i am so sorry i went to the deepest darkest corner of the coldest dampest room in the dirtiest filthiest cavern under the monastery down the long corridor to the door but there were magical fires and i dropped the key in the first one as i leapt over it  


do not worry for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment the second key however is far far away in canada  


the new monk left the monastery and travelled to canada it took many years because he had no money being a monk and all  


eventually he arrived in canada and managed to track down the key to the door the monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly but finally he arrived back at the monastery down into the deepest darkest corner of the coldest dampest room in the dirtiest filthiest cavern under the monastery he went until he found the long corridor  


the three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start  


over the first fire went the monk key still in hand  


over the second fire went the monk key still rats  
he had dropped the key in the second fire the monk leapt back over the second fire back over the first fire back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest darkest corner of the coldest dampest room in the dirtiest filthiest cavern under the monastery the monk went back to the head monk  


oh mr monk i am so sorry i went to the deepest darkest corner of the coldest dampest room in the dirtiest filthiest cavern under the monastery down the long corridor to the door but there were magical fires and i dropped the key in the second one as i leapt over it  


do not worry for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment the third key however is far far away in australia  


the monk left the monastery and travelled to australia it took many years because he had no money being a monk and all  


eventually he arrived in australia and managed to track down the key to the door the monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly but finally he arrived back at the monastery by this time he was quite an old monk  


down into the deepest darkest corner of the coldest dampest room in the dirtiest filthiest cavern under the monastery he went until he found the long corridor the three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start  


over the first fire went the quite old monk key still in hand  


over the second fire went the quite old monk key still in hand  


over the third fire went the quite old monk key still in hand  


he had made it hed made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question finally finally after so many many many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise he would know the answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself  


slowly the quite old monk slid the key into the lock turning the key a slight click was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door he pushed the door open and stepped inside  


shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question  


do you want me to tell you what it was

" 

my grandfather was always playing pranks on people he was originally from ireland before he moved to the us he fit all of the stereotypes of an irishman having red hair and beard constantly being at the bar and having an accent so thick that i could barely understand him even though i knew him for years

in addition to all these traits grandpa was a rather short man everyone he met called him a leprechaun always asking him for his pot of gold or his lucky charms they even called him a leprechaun while he still lived in ireland saying he was the spitting image of one

at first he was annoyed just wanting to get a drink without the hassle but after a while he began to take advantage of the name he was always getting people at the bar to do stupid stuff for a chance at a pot of gold after all it isnt that hard to convince a drunk person that a short irish ginger is an actual leprechaun

he was doing this for decades and without fail there would always be at least one person at the bar he frequents that would try to get a pot of gold

many years passed and grandpa started to go to the bar less and less he said since he was getting older he would much rather stay at home and watch whatever is on the television instead of going out to bars getting drunk and playing pranks

a few years later grandpa was hospitalized doctors said it was his liver failing even though he stopped drinking recently all the decades of abuse his liver took have finally caught up to him instead of being horrified or worried grandpa looked peaceful almost relieved he began to calmly write his will giving his possessions away to family members

for most people he wrote down normal items like his car television or house but he gave me something very different instead of including it in his will he decided to give it to me in person when there was nobody else around

listen be began to say to me i need to tell you something very important all those years of joking about being a leprechaun those were not jokes i really am a leprechaun here take this he said handing me what looks like a small lump of metal that my boy is my pot of gold it might not look like much now but if you place it down at the end of a rainbow it will explode into a shower of golden coins its very important that you tell nobody about this

of course i thought he was just pulling another prank like he has all these years before but honestly what do i have to lose the next time i found a rainbow i placed the metal at the end of it im waiting for something to happen as im writing this ill keep you updated

"in a 4 stroke engine during the compression stroke a gasolineair mixture is compressed inside the combustion chamber this decrease in volume leads to an increase in pressure which in turn leads to an increase in temperature i understand that the increased temperature leads to better fuel vaporization for the same reason that boiling a pot of water will increase the vaporization of that water however the pressure is also increasing  doesnt that work against the goal of increasing the fuel vaporization in other words doesnt the increased pressure work to condense the fuel out of vapor and into droplets 

maybe both of these forces are acting on the fuel but the temperature increase has a larger effect and wins out causing more vaporization to occur than the pressure increase causes condensation how is the amount of vaporization even measured

ive been trying to figure out exactly how a compression stroke in an engine increases the engines efficiency ive found many articlesposts about the effect of the increase in temperature but nothing mentioning the condensing effects of increased pressure

as a tangent if i take a sealed disposable water bottle with a few droplets of water in it and i twist it like thishttpsapictureofvancouveradayfileswordpresscom201109twistedwaterbottlejpg to increase the pressure inside the temperature will increase if i then leave the bottle untouched for a while so that the heat dissipates and it returns to room temperature then there will be fewer water molecules in a gaseous state compared to before i twisted the bottle is that correct",why does the compression of fuelair in an engine increase vaporization,1

light years apart at time point t bob now selects one of the two options  
if his choice falls on a he leaves his particles undisturbed so that alices test results soon after should still strongly suggest the entanglement of her respective pairs of particles which would lead her to suspect bob selected a  
if he goes for b he measures all of his particles collapsing the respective superpositions to either 000gt or 111gt which are unentangled pure states alices test for entanglement then likely reveals the new random nature in absence of entanglement eg different spin directions when measured at certain angles her conclusion would be that bob selectedsent b

would it be possible for someone with adhd to also have a condition that results in elevated norepinephrine such as hyperpots pheochromocytoma or chronic stress im pretty sure that chronic stress doesnt cure adhd but wouldnt it balance out your levels if they were already low a sudden scare can trigger a release of epinephrinenorepinephrine adreneline rush but i dont think that purposely scaring adhd people helps them focus

conditions that increase norepinephrine specifically hyperpots and pheochromocytoma are partially diagnosed by a blood test to test the norepinephrine levels in the blood xhttpswwwhealthlinecomhealthcatecholaminesblood if a blood test can accurately find out if there is too much norepinephrine why cant a blood test that tests for low levels be used to diagnose adhd

finally snris seem like a common treatment for anxiety however they increase norepinephrine isnt this the last thing you would want if you are already feeling anxious

so my question is if strong and weak nuclear forces are technically more powerful than gravity how can neutron stars come to exist how can gravity overcome nuclear forces and start fusing the atoms in the core of the stars together in ways that are not natural

"i know that w0 for matter leads to a shrinking energy density as the universe grows and therefore the contribution to h from matter will shrink but this is different from matter reducing the value of h  if more dirt was added to the universe wouldnt the energy density and thus acceleration increase  eventually the dirt would become spread out by the size of the universe and its contribution would tend toward 0 but never is this dirt slowing the expansion

ampnbsp

it sounds pedantic but as i understand it a better description would be that w0 matter adds to expansion in a way that decreases with a and therefore time and so in a matter dominated universe the expansion slows but doesnt stop see the at23 equation or whatever due to as increasing not directly due to that matter  this makes a difference as when i was taught it the reductive dark matter slows expansion statement misled me greatly

additionally i know the h2  density equation but is there anything that says when solving for h we must take the positive square root for expansion and not the negative for shrinkage",why is regulardark matter w0 said to slow down expansion i thought the friedman equations say that energy density regardless of equation of state cause expansion,1
i realize one of the major problems with taking antibiotics is that it also kills healthy bacteria in the gut microbiota so it got me thinking if stopping antibiotic treatment early can lead to antibiotic resistant bacteria would the same logic also apply to good bacteria if we worked out a correct probiotic supplement regime could the law of probability allow good bacteria to eventually colonize to a level whereby antibiotic resistance to things like amoxicillin could be achieved thus negating many side effects of antibiotics and their effect on the gut microbiota,could beneficial bacteria from probiotics form antibiotic resistance too,1

"so as i understand it vapor pressure is the pressure inside a container when the liquid has evaporated enough to fully saturate the rest of the container and it reaches a equilibrium this is what gives some aerosol cans their consistent pressure when a liquid like butane evaporates at is vapor pressure to fill the space when using a can this is also why a cold can has less pressure because the vapor pressure is lower correct

where as the critical point is when a liquid and its vapor coexist in equilibrium and it becomes super critical above this point where the gas and liquid are basically the same density

the second question i have is the removal of the former island that the coral reef rings around how does this precisely happen i recall watching a video where it was stated that the weight of the reef somehow has something to do with it or is it more to do with erosion wouldnt a barrier reef prevent erosion to a degree

and the last question i have is concerning the make up of islands since new caldonia gt40mya is older geologically speaking than midway island 27mya and the two are completely different one is an atoll the other is a proper island which is a roundabout way of asking is the geological makeup of an atoll more prone to erosion than a regular island",location of atolls atlantic vs pacific and several other atoll related questions,1

"so i understand that when im writing a linked list and a node points to another node it is the memory address where the first node is stored pointing to another so like if you have a table of memory addresses if the first node is stored at memory location n and the second node is stored at memory location k you would just have to iterate kn times through the table from node n to get to location k however id assume that in a real system you may sometimes run into a problem where weirdly spaced blocks of this memory table have been allocated to other programs more formally if i have a memory demand of k memory units for some program x and there is already an allocated block of memory for some program z starting at address k minus some nonzero constant y and ending at an address n st ngtk will my memory assignment program try to reallocate the memory for z or will it split the memory for program x into blocks 10ky and 2nk if it is the latter then doesnt that present a routing problem as in if my memory circuit is laid out in vertical rows where the height of each row is length of memory address tablenumber of rows and i have a large gap between blocks 1 and 2one that may even span multiple rows at some pointi hypothesize that it may become quicker to traverse the memory circuit horizontally rather than to iterate through the entire block of program zs allocated memory 
tldr
can a memory circuit be visualized as a linked list does memory always reallocate if it doesnt does traversing the memory circuit linearly between referenced memory locations impose a demand on processing power why cant we or do we produce circuits where memory units are laid out in a complete graph configuration where every unit is connected to every other unit",on the level of hardware how do pointers work,1

"for example jupiter which is thought to have moved out from the inner solar system via encounters with saturn or the hypothesized planet 9 which could have been throw out past the oort cloud  or any other body that has been flung by a larger body   

its my current understanding that these perturbations would produce a very elliptical orbit with the perturbed body still coming back down into a similar au for instance a spacecraft must perform a burn at the highest point in its orbit to circularize but what mechanism causes a body flung out into a distant location to stay there",how did the perturbed orbits of planetsprotoplanets in the early solar system become circularized,1

"what species of bird has undergone the fewest amount of changes in its genetic code since modern birds first evolved 
is there any way to tell that 
with the genetic material we have available from both living and extinct species of birds we can reconstruct the genetic structure of the most recent common ancestor to all birds to some extent could we compare that to the genomes of living birds to see which birds genetic material has changed the least

isnt temperature related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the gas im imagining that in a near vacuum like in interstellar space it is pretty rare for two gas molecules to even collide with each other would that mean that the average velocity of a hydrogen atom would be dependent more on the relative velocity between our solar system and where ever that particle was coming from rather than getting its velocity from bouncing into other molecules in the cloud,how is the temperature of the interstellar gas measured,1

"i had this thought when reading about stellar constructs

i realize it only applies to special cases but what determines those cases i have found some contradictory answers some say its because gravity can be neglected and some say its because it only describes events that unfold in inertial frames of reference,why is it called the special theory of relativity,1
"so as i understand it vapor pressure is the pressure inside a container when the liquid has evaporated enough to fully saturate the rest of the container and it reaches a equilibrium this is what gives some aerosol cans their consistent pressure when a liquid like butane evaporates at is vapor pressure to fill the space when using a can this is also why a cold can has less pressure because the vapor pressure is lower correct

where as the critical point is when a liquid and its vapor coexist in equilibrium and it becomes super critical above this point where the gas and liquid are basically the same density 

so what exactly is the difference if c02 has a vapor pressure of 350 kpa at 25c as i understand then why is the supercritical point 7380 kpa at 31c when both would be a liquid and a gas in a container i dont understand the differences between the two

critical care rn and consumer here  routinely i give po multivitamins usually through a dhtngogpeg to my patients and take a one a day vitamin myself  my question is does the multivitamin actually work at correctingmaintaining adequate healthy levels in the body  i know that its a supplement not medication therefore its not regulated by the fda and i know that problems with absorptiondistribution can be a factor  but i havent been able to find any papers or reviews providing data on whether or not these multivitamins work in a perfectly healthy human  is it worth taking these vitamins  do they actually do anything,are multivitamins effective at correcting vitamin deficiencies,1
"i have the impression that plants have no builtin age limit like humans and many animals if perfect conditions persist indefinitely it looks like plants can also live indefinitely i am primarily thinking of trees but ive read about herbaceous plants that can resprout annually apparently without limits

in humans ive been told that telomeres partly determine the lifespan they reduce in length every cell division and when worn away genetic material deteriorate from the edges of the chromosomes does plant chromosomes have telomeres how is genetic material preserved in plants for such long time periods

does the age of viable seeds determine lifespan of plants some seeds may stay viable for decades and longer are there any notable differences between two individuals of a species who have sprouted from very differently aged seeds",why doesnt plants seem to have an age limit,1
"ive been reading that one of the largest hurdles in 5g distribution is that due to the high frequency the signal has a hard time navigating through walls trees people etc

my understanding is that the higher the frequency in this situation the higher rate of interaction with its environment however i cant reconcile this with my understanding of the waves at the further extremes of the spectrum xrays gamma and the like which need inches potentially feet of lead housing to handle

thinking about how the earths atmosphere seems to attenuate the high frequency radiations it makes sense that they in fact do interact more but why then do we see the seemingly opposite effect with the necessity of lead boxes

i dont understand the seeming duality",do high frequency waves interact more than low,1

"hey askscience id need help from some people that know a little in genetics

in general since x and y chromosomes arent homologous the y one being smaller crossingovers cant happen between then 

in any way i read in some science magazines that the x and the y chromosomes still have some homologous parts between them so would this mean that a crossingover would happen 

ampx200b

background info  in bio class we had a test on genetics the subject was on the color of a cats robe which depends on 2 allelles from x chromosomes eumelanin that codes a black fur and phreomelanin that codes an orange fur plenty of female cats have a tortie fur a mix of both colours since they have 2 x chromosomes our aim was to show how certain male cats could have a tortie robe

the main answer was a trisomy after during anaphase i so one of the cells had 2x chrs one with the xn allelle and on with xr allelle if this cell had children there could be one with xrxny which would be a male tortie

if the loci of xn and xr arent the same there can be a crossingover between the 2xs leading to one x having both allelles and the male descendant would also be tortie

but if the loci of the allelles werent specified in the test subject we can perfectly extrapolate if the x and y chromosomes have only a small homologuous part there can be a crossingover between them even really unlikely so one allelle is on the y chromosome and a descendant could be xnyr or xryn 

my teacher is really stubborn she only believes in the magazine nature but any renowned scientific could be ok

"so in feynman diagrams usually a fermion where the arrow points goes from left to right is a fermion while if it goes from right to left it is an antifermion which is then interpreted as going backwards in time as the xaxis is the axis of time 

but in many diagrams you have a fermion line that goes vertically examples one diagram of compton scattering neutral pion decay 

as i interpret it  this actually stands for a superposition of two diagrams   one where this line represents a fermion and one where it represents an antifermion you would then have to sum over those two matrix elements is that a valid interpretation",how should tchannel fermions in feynman diagrams be interpreted,1

gtthe brain is just slow it doesnt work fast it works quite slowly and theres many domains in which thats the case in many ways the most striking one is vision if you look at the visual system the cells of the retina are actually responsive to single photons of light they give you a maximal amount of information the brain doesnt want all that information itd just be way overloaded if it ever got that kind of information inside so whatever the visual system is doing the first step is throwing out almost all the information thats coming from the retina and apparently every sensory system is like that the first thing it does is throw away just about everything and try to get down to something limited enough so this slow brain up here can deal with it somehow

"hey askscience id need help from some people that know a little in genetics

in general since x and y chromosomes arent homologous the y one being smaller crossingovers cant happen between then 

in any way i read in some science magazines that the x and the y chromosomes still have some homologous parts between them so would this mean that a crossingover would happen 

ampx200b

background info  in bio class we had a test on genetics the subject was on the color of a cats robe which depends on 2 allelles from x chromosomes eumelanin that codes a black fur and phreomelanin that codes an orange fur plenty of female cats have a tortie fur a mix of both colours since they have 2 x chromosomes our aim was to show how certain male cats could have a tortie robe

the main answer was a trisomy after during anaphase i so one of the cells had 2x chrs one with the xn allelle and on with xr allelle if this cell had children there could be one with xrxny which would be a male tortie

if the loci of xn and xr arent the same there can be a crossingover between the 2xs leading to one x having both allelles and the male descendant would also be tortie

but if the loci of the allelles werent specified in the test subject we can perfectly extrapolate if the x and y chromosomes have only a small homologuous part there can be a crossingover between them even really unlikely so one allelle is on the y chromosome and a descendant could be xnyr or xryn

"does the repressor completely block binding of rna polymerase to the promoter or does it only prevent the initiation of transcription

im asking this because we talked about 2 experiments in class that seemed to contradict each other

one experiment used a run off transcription assay and found that a runoff product was generated suggesting that rnap was capable of binding to the promoter when the repressor was bound to the operator

another experiment used chip and concluded that rnap could only bind to the promoter when the repressor was not bound to the operator
