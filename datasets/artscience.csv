This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/amj68a/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xx/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

---

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

-----------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

For the Earth and the Moon, the ratio of mass between the Moon and the Earth is so weighted on Earth's side that the moon goes in orbit around the centre of mass of the Earth. However, suppose that we have two bodies that are similar in mass and size.

&lt;p&gt;I thought it might have to do with the fact that the operon has 3 operators (O1, O2, and O3) but im not sure. Sorry if the experiments are vague, i can describe them in more detail if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field.

Hello I've recently been creating a fantasy map and was looking up Atolls and I've several questions about them.

The first, is why are there so few Atolls in the Atlantic (only off the coast of Belize) while the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean are chalk full of them. I presume this is due to lack of Volcanic activity in the Atlantic ocean in area where reefs can form but then that leads to another question about the lack of Volcanic hot-spots in the Atlantic.

The second question I have is the removal of the former Island that the coral reef rings around. How does this precisely happen? I recall watching a video where it was stated that the weight of the reef somehow has something to do with it, or is it more to do with Erosion (wouldn't a barrier reef prevent erosion to a degree)?

And the last question I have is concerning the make up of islands. Since New Caldonia (&gt;40MYA) is older geologically speaking than Midway Island (27MYA) and the two are completely different (one is an Atoll the other is a proper island).

,askscience,"Hey Askscience, I'd need help from some people that know a little in Genetics.

In general, since X and Y chromosomes aren't homologous, the Y one being smaller, ""crossing-overs"" can't happen between then. 

In any way, I read in some science magazines, that the X and the Y chromosomes still have some homologous parts between them. So would this mean that a ""crossing-over would happen ?

&amp;#x200B;

Background info : In bio class we had a test on genetics. The subject was on the color of a cat's robe, which depends on 2 allelles from X chromosomes. Eumelanin that codes a black fur and Phreomelanin that codes an orange fur. Plenty of female cats have a ""tortie"" fur, a mix of both colours, since they have 2 X chromosomes. Our aim was to show how certain male cats could have a ""tortie"" robe.

The main answer was a trisomy, after during Anaphase I so one of the cells had 2X chrs, one with the Xn allelle and on with Xr allelle. If this cell had children, there could be one with XrXnY, which would be a male ""tortie"".

If the loci of Xn and Xr aren't the same, there can be a crossing-over between the 2X's leading to one X having both allelles and the male descendant would also be ""tortie"".

But if the loci of the allelles weren't specified in the test subject, we can perfectly extrapolate if the X and Y chromosomes have only a small Homologuous part, there can be a crossing-over between them (even really unlikely) so one allelle is on the Y chromosome, and a descendant could be XnYr or XrYn ?

My teacher is really stubborn, she only believes in the magazine ""Nature"". But any renowned scientific could be ok.

Can any of you help me on this subject ?

This morning one of my workmates (not someone who I believe makes things up or tells tall tales) told me a story about a guy he knew who was struck by lightning. As his story went, he was in a forest when a lightning storm began. He sat against a tree to wait the storm out. That tree was struck by lightning, which traveled through the tree and him. He suffered burns along his head and body and it &amp;quot;blew his boots off.&amp;quot; Supposedly the force was so great that his boots, which were shin high, separated at the ankles and the bottoms were blown off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this story plausible? If so, what is the force that would cause this explosive separation? Also, why would it not destroy the person&amp;#39;s feet in the process?&lt;/p&gt;

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

So apparently ADHD is linked to a deficiency of norepinephrine ([x](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-neuroscience-101/)). Norepinephrine is also linked to the fight or flight response, and increases heart rate, blood pressure and anxiety ([x](https://www.hormone.org/your-health-and-hormones/glands-and-hormones-a-to-z/hormones/norepinephrine), [x](https://www.healthline.com/health/epinephrine-vs-norepinephrine)). Comorbid ADHD and anxiety are also very common ([x](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/anxiety-adhd-link#1)). I've heard anxiety (specifically GAD) described as a permanent/extended fight or flight response where there is no danger but the brain/body still thinks there is. Since norepinephrine raises with anxiety/the fight or flight response, it is higher in those with anxiety or extended stress than without ([x](https://exploringyourmind.com/chronic-anxiety-and-its-link-to-norepinephrine/)). It seems to me that ADHD has a chronic deficiency of norepinephrine, while those with chronic anxiety generally have too much. How can these two things be true at the same time? 

Would it be possible for someone with ADHD to also have a condition that results in elevated norepinephrine, such as hyperPOTS, pheochromocytoma, or chronic stress? I'm pretty sure that chronic stress doesn't cure ADHD, but wouldn't it balance out your levels if they were already low? A sudden scare can trigger a release of epinephrine/norepinephrine (adreneline rush). But I don't think that purposely scaring ADHD people helps them focus?

Conditions that increase norepinephrine (specifically hyperPOTS and pheochromocytoma) are partially diagnosed by a blood test to test the norepinephrine levels in the blood ([x](https://www.healthline.com/health/catecholamines-blood)). If a blood test can accurately find out if there is too much norepinephrine, why can't a blood test that tests for low levels be used to diagnose ADHD?

Finally, SNRIs seem like a common treatment for anxiety. However, they increase norepinephrine. Isn't this the last thing you would want if you are already feeling anxious?

The basic mechanic of the game is that you have to throw stuff overboard in order to gain enough altitude to pass safely over an erupting volcano.  


16 years later, I'm working on a loose sequel, set on board an imaginary British space module in 1967. The module has failed to reach the moon, the calculations having been thrown off by a lot of extraneous stuff having been smuggled on board by the astronauts prior to take off. It is now heading back to Earth. My idea for the game is similar to the first one, in that you have to jettison mass in order to correct the angle of entry, so all that extra stuff has to go out through the jettison hatch.   


Like the first game, it's not particularly realistic, but like the first game, I would like it to have *some* basis in reality. So my question in broad, general terms, is would ejecting mass from a spacecraft re-entering Earth's atmosphere cause it re-enter at a shallower angle? Assume that the astronauts have limited fuel and no other options at their disposal.

,askscience,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate.

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a question within these topics you weren&amp;#39;t sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical &lt;a href=""/r/AskScience""&gt;/r/AskScience&lt;/a&gt; post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &amp;quot;What would happen if...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How will the future...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;If all the rules for &amp;#39;X&amp;#39; were different...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Why does my...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit &lt;a href=""/r/AskScienceDiscussion""&gt;/r/AskScienceDiscussion&lt;/a&gt; , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience""&gt;The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate.

,askscience,"Botanical dietary supplements, sometimes called herbals or herbal dietary supplements, and essential oils are products made from plants, plant parts, or plant extracts. One study found that natural products, including botanical dietary supplements, are used by approximately [15% of adults](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211315) and are widely available in the United States. In fact, according to the [American Botanical Council](http://cms.herbalgram.org/press/2019/2018HerbMarketReport.html), Americans spent a total of $8.8 billion on botanical dietary supplements in 2018.

But, just because a product is from a plant source and sold in stores or online, doesntt mean it's safe. The safety of a botanical or essential oil depends on many things, such as its chemical makeup, how it works in the body, how it is prepared, and the dose used.

The amount of scientific evidence available for various botanical supplement ingredients varies widely, in part, because product safety is not tested by FDA and federal law does not require dietary supplements be tested for effectiveness before they are marketed.

Studying the potential effects of botanical dietary supplements has several unique challenges. For example, all botanical dietary supplements contain a complex mixture of ingredients, making it difficult to identify and link active ingredients to health effects. Growing, harvesting, and processing conditions can also affect the chemical makeup of a botanical supplement, leading to challenges in manufacturing identical products batch after batch. Possible contaminants - either accidental or intentional via adulteration - in botanical dietary supplements (e.g. heavy metals, microbes, undeclared ingredients, or pesticides) needs to be
determined as part of routine quality control since these can affect its safety.

Our hosts today are all experts on studying the quality, safety, and/or efficacy of botanical dietary supplements and essential oils to better understand how to use them more safely and effectively.

So like if you have a table of memory addresses, if the first node is stored at memory location n and the second node is stored at memory location k, you would just have to iterate (k-n) times through the table (from node n) to get to location k. However, I'd assume that in a real system, you may sometimes run into a problem where weirdly spaced blocks of this memory table have been allocated to other programs. More formally, if I have a memory demand of k memory units for some program x, and there is already an allocated block of memory for some program z starting at (address k minus some non-zero constant y) and ending at an address n s.t n&gt;k; will my memory assignment program try to reallocate the memory for z or will it split the memory for program x into blocks 1:(0,k-y) and 2:(n,k)?

,askscience,"I've been listening to some of Sean Carroll's explanations on the subject on some podcasts, and his explanation seems to be.....lacking some explanations that would actually clarify the issue.  I'll expand on this into a couple questions.

1.  He speaks about there being a divergence, duplication, or split of worlds when a wave function collapses.  He says that the other ""world"" exists in a different set of dimensions in Hilbert space.  (I think I'm understanding this correctly but please correct if wrong).  My question is, how does the duplication or split not require more energy than what was already contained within the particle?  How is there a duplication without the need for added energy?  If you don't need additional energy, wouldn't the resulting ""world's"" particle have less energy than the original one?
2. Once the wave function of the particle collapses, is it then always ""collapsed"" in all worlds? Or can it then split yet again?
3. How do we know that quantum particles are actually probabilistic instead of us just not understanding why they appear to behave that way?  Couldn't a fast enough oscillation between two states make it appear that a particle/wave function follows a given probability?
4. Does referring to these particles as ""wave functions"" mean that they are supposedly just mathematical principles floating around and not actual packets or energy or particles?  The way this subject is talked about makes it seem that the people studying this believe this to be the case.

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."". 

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

,askscience,"It seems as though popular explanations of concepts like dark matter and dark energy come in the form of ""the best mathematical model we currently have to fit a set of observations, such as the cosmic background radiation and the apparent acceleration of inflation, imply that there must be far more matter and more energy than the matter and energy that we can observe, so we hypothesize the existence of various forms of dark matter and dark energy.""

This kind of explanation seems baffling. I would think that if a model doesn't account for all of the observations, such as *both* CBR and acceleration *and* the observed amount of matter and energy in the universe, then the most obvious hypothesis would not be that there must be matter and energy we can't observe, but that the mathematical model must be inaccurate. In other fields, if a model doesn't account for observations using methods that were themselves used to construct the model, it is far more natural to think that this would tend to suggest that the model is wrong or incomplete rather than that the observations are wrong or incomplete. 

There seems to be an implied rejoinder: the Standard Model of the universe is really accurate at mathematically formulating many observations and predicting many observations that were subsequently confirmed, and there is so far no better model, so we have reason to think that unobservable things implied by it actually exist unless someone can propose an even better mathematical model. This also seems baffling: why would the assumption be that reality conforms to a single consistent mathematical formulation discoverable by us or any mathematical formulation at all? Ordinarily we would think that math can represent idealized versions of the physical world but would not insist that the physical world conform itself to a mathematical model. For example, if we imagine handling a cylindrical container full of water, which we empty into vessel on the scale, if the weight of the of the water is less than that which would be predicted according to the interior measurements of the container and the cylinder volume equation, no one would think to look for 'light liquid,' they would just assume that the vessel wasn't a perfect cylinder, wasn't completely full of water, or for some other reason the equation they were using did not match the reality of the objects they were measuring. 

So this is puzzling to me.

Thank you.",t2_3qt2h,False,,0,False,"Why do cosmologists hypothesize the existence of unobservable matter or force(s) to fit standard model predictions instead of assuming that the standard model is, like classical mechanics, incomplete?",[],r/askscience,False,6,physics,0,False,t3_drggcs,False,dark,,public,2267,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Physics,False,2267,,,False,,[],[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1572896492.0,text,6,,text,self.askscience,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems as though popular explanations of concepts like dark matter and dark energy come in the form of &amp;quot;the best mathematical model we currently have to fit a set of observations, such as the cosmic background radiation and the apparent acceleration of inflation, imply that there must be far more matter and more energy than the matter and energy that we can observe, so we hypothesize the existence of various forms of dark matter and dark energy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of explanation seems baffling. I would think that if a model doesn&amp;#39;t account for all of the observations, such as &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; CBR and acceleration &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the observed amount of matter and energy in the universe, then the most obvious hypothesis would not be that there must be matter and energy we can&amp;#39;t observe, but that the mathematical model must be inaccurate. In other fields, if a model doesn&amp;#39;t account for observations using methods that were themselves used to construct the model, it is far more natural to think that this would tend to suggest that the model is wrong or incomplete rather than that the observations are wrong or incomplete. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be an implied rejoinder: the Standard Model of the universe is really accurate at mathematically formulating many observations and predicting many observations that were subsequently confirmed, and there is so far no better model, so we have reason to think that unobservable things implied by it actually exist unless someone can propose an even better mathematical model. This also seems baffling: why would the assumption be that reality conforms to a single consistent mathematical formulation discoverable by us or any mathematical formulation at all? Ordinarily we would think that math can represent idealized versions of the physical world but would not insist that the physical world conform itself to a mathematical model. For example, if we imagine handling a cylindrical container full of water, which we empty into vessel on the scale, if the weight of the of the water is less than that which would be predicted according to the interior measurements of the container and the cylinder volume equation, no one would think to look for &amp;#39;light liquid,&amp;#39; they would just assume that the vessel wasn&amp;#39;t a perfect cylinder, wasn&amp;#39;t completely full of water, or for some other reason the equation they were using did not match the reality of the objects they were measuring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is puzzling to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also sufficiently obvious a question that I assume physicists have a coherent answer to it which I just haven&amp;#39;t heard (I also haven&amp;#39;t this question posed, but I&amp;#39;m not a physicist so it wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily come up). &lt;/p&gt;
